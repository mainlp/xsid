# From Masked-Language Modeling to Translation: Non-English Auxiliary Tasks Improve Zero-shot Spoken Language Understanding

This repository contains all code to reproduce the results in the paper. If you are just here for the data, see the `data/` folder (AND DON'T FORGET TO CITE THE PAPERS LISTED BELOW) 

[![data](table.png)]()

**NOTE**: Thanks to Evgeniia Razumovskaia, we have found some errors in the original data. We have kept the original data in the repo for reproducability reasons and the fixed version can be found in data/xSID-0.2. The main differences are in Arabic, where we forgot to map the intent labels.

**NOTE** 02-11-2021: Thanks to NoÃ«mi Aepli, we have fixed the sentences in the English dev/test files to match the other languages. And thanks to Milan Grita we have corrected mismatches in words in the comments and the annotation (mainly in the English files).

**NOTE** 29-03-2022: There was an error in the nluEval.py code for calculating the loose overlap (thanks to Mike Zhang for finding and fixing it). The results in the paper for loose f1 were unfortunately overly optimistic.

**UPDATE** 05-2023: version 0.4 is released, including Neapolitan and Swiss German

**UPDATE** 04-2024: version 0.5 is released, including Bavarian and Lithuanian, please also see [https://github.com/mainlp/NaLiBaSID/tree/main](https://github.com/mainlp/NaLiBaSID/tree/main) for alternatives for these languages (including native queries!).

To reproduce all results in the paper, you have to run `./scripts/runAll.sh`. However, in practice this would take a very long time (especially when rerunning nmt-transfer, `./scripts/1.\*`), which is why we would suggest to inspect `./scripts/runAll.sh`, decide which parts are relevant for you, and manually run the required commands parallel. It should be noted that some of the scripts may fail, because we used the MultiAtis dataset, which is not publicly available. To run the experiments on those, [obtain the data](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2021T04), convert it with `scripts/tsv2conll.py` in `data/multiAtis`. Alternatively, one could remove the `MultiAtis` key from the `datasets` dictionary in `scripts/myutils.py`. All tables and graphs of the paper can be reproduced by running `scripts/genAll.sh`.

The experiments are divided in the scripts folder:

* 0.\* Data preparation and setup 
* 1.\* Translated the training data for the `nmt-transfer` model 
* 2.\* Trains MaChAmp for all languages and predicts on all files 
* 3.\* Generated the main table in the paper 
* 4.\* Run on the test data 
* 5.\* All additional experiments for the analysis section in the paper 
* 6.\* Generate all tables for the appendix 

For many parts we also included the outputs so that it is not always necessary to re-run. The automatically translated training data as well as the automatically converted English training data can be found in `/data/xSID/`. The output predictions and scores of all models are also included in `predictions/`.

This code is largely based on [MaChAmp](https://machamp-nlp.github.io/), we include a copy of the exact version of MaChAmp that was used.
