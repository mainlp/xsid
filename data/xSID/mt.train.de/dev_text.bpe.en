One of the things that defin@@ es a TE@@ D@@ ster is you've taken your passion , and you've turned it into ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship .
You actually put action to the issues you care about .
But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out .
So , how do you do that ?
One of the things I should probably tell you is , I worked for the Dis@@ covery Channel early in my career , and that sort of war@@ ped my fra@@ me@@ work .
So , when you start to think about politicians , you've got to realize these are strange creatures .
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions , and they have very strange bre@@ eding habits , how do you actually work with these things ? ( Laughter ) What we need to understand is: What drives the political creature ?
And there are two things that are primary in a politici@@ an's heart@@ : One is reputation and influence .
These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job .
The second one -- unlike most animals , which is survival of the species -- this is pre@@ servation of self .
Now you may think it's money , but that's actually sort of a pro@@ xy to what I can do to preserve myself .
Now , the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time .
So , what doesn't work , in terms of getting your issue to be important ?
You can send them an email .
Well , unfortunately , I've got so many Vi@@ a@@ gra ads coming at me , your email is lost .
It doesn't matter , it's sp@@ am .
How about you get on the phone ?
Well , chances are I've got a dro@@ id who's picking up the phone , " Yes , they called , and they said they didn't like it . "
That doesn't move .
Face to face would work , but it's hard to set it up .
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work .
Yes , contri@@ bu@@ tions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation , but it takes some time to build up .
So what actually works ?
And the answer is rather strange .
It's a letter .
We live in a digital world , but we're fairly an@@ alog creatures .
Let@@ ters actually work .
Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff .
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean .
So , how are you going to write your letter ?
First of all , you're going to pick up an an@@ alog de@@ vi@@ ce: a pen .
I know these are tough , and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it , ( Laughter ) but this is actually critical .
And it is critical that you actually hand@@ write your letter .
It is so novel to see this , that somebody actually picked up an an@@ alog device and has written to me .
Second of all , I'm going to recommend that you get into a pro@@ active stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month .
Here's my promise to you: If you are consistent and do this , within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say , " What do you think ? "
Now , I'm going to give you a four para@@ graph form@@ at to work with .
Now , when you approach these animals , you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them , and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of war@@ iness .
So in para@@ graph number one , what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this: You appreciate them .
You may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig .
When animals are going to make a point , they make the point .
They don't spend a lot of time di@@ cking around .
So , here you go . ( Laughter ) Para@@ graph number two@@ : You may actually have to just get very bl@@ unt and say what's really on your mind .
When you do this , don't attack people ; you attack tac@@ tics .
A@@ d hom@@ in@@ em attacks will get you nowhere .
Para@@ graph number thre@@ e: When animals are attacked or cor@@ ner@@ ed , they will fight to the death , so you have to give them an exit .
Most of the time , if they have an exit strategy , they should take it .
" Obviously , you're intelligent .
If you had the right information , you would have done the right thing . " ( Laughter ) La@@ stly , you want to be the nur@@ turing agent .
You're the safe place to come in to .
So , in para@@ graph number four , you're going to tell people , " If no one is provi@@ ding you with this information , let me help . " ( Laughter ) An@@ im@@ als do disp@@ la@@ ys . They do two thin@@ gs@@ : They warn you or they try to attract you and say , " We need to mate . "
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter .
You do a number of thin@@ gs@@ : you're a vice president , you volunteer , you do something else .
Why is is this important ?
Because this establi@@ shes the two primary c@@ rit@@ eria for the political cre@@ atu@@ re@@ : that you have influence in a large sphere , and that my pre@@ servation depends on you .
Here is one very quick hack , especially for the feds in the audience .
Here's how you mail your letter .
First of all , you send the original to the district office .
So , you send the copy to the main office .
If they follow protocol , they'll pick up the phone and say , " Hey , do you have the original ? "
Then some dro@@ id in the back puts the name on a ti@@ ck@@ ler and says , " Oh , this is an important letter . "
And you actually get into the fol@@ der that the elected official actually has to read .
So , what your letter me@@ ans@@ : I've got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pin@@ at@@ as .
( Laughter ) We are ha@@ ran@@ gu@@ ed , le@@ ctured to , sold , mar@@ ket@@ ed , but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication .
I got this letter when I was first elected , and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to .
This is an opportunity at real di@@ alogue , and if you have ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship and want to communicate , that di@@ alogue is incredibly powerful .
So when you do that , here's what I can prom@@ i@@ se: You're going to be the 800 pound gor@@ illa in the forest .
Get writing .
( Applause ) Na@@ ma@@ ste . Sala@@ am .

Greetings to all of you from Pakistan .
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know .
And Pakistan , in this particular v@@ ein , is very similar .
Because it has provo@@ ked , and does provo@@ ke , a vis@@ cer@@ al anxiety in the bel@@ lies of many a Western soul , especially when vie@@ wed through the mon@@ o@@ ch@@ rom@@ atic l@@ ens of tur@@ bul@@ ence and tur@@ mo@@ il .
But there are many other dimen@@ sions to Pakistan .
And what follows is a stream of images , a series of images captured by some of Paki@@ stan@@ 's most dynami@@ c and young photogra@@ pher@@ s , that aim@@ s to give you an alternative gli@@ mp@@ se , a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Paki@@ stan@@ i citizens .
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you .
My name is Ab@@ dul Khan . I come from P@@ es@@ ha@@ war .
I hope that you will be able to see not just my Tali@@ ban@@ -@@ like beard , but also the rich@@ ness and color of my per@@ cep@@ tions , as@@ pi@@ rations and dreams , as rich and col@@ or@@ ful as the sat@@ ch@@ els that I sell .
My name is Me@@ her and this is my friend I@@ ri@@ m .
I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gil@@ g@@ it , nor@@ thern Pakistan .
My name is Ka@@ il@@ ash . And I like to en@@ rich lives through techn@@ ic@@ ol@@ ored glass .
Madame , would you like some of those orange b@@ ang@@ les with the pink pol@@ ka do@@ ts ?
My name is Z@@ amin .
And I'm an ID@@ P , an inter@@ n@@ ally disp@@ laced person , from Sw@@ at .
Do you see me on the other side of this fence ?
Do I matter , or really exist for you ?
My name is I@@ man . I am a fashion model , an up@@ -and-@@ coming model from La@@ hore .
Do you see me simply smo@@ thered in cloth ?
Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside ?
My name is Ah@@ med . I am an Af@@ g@@ han refu@@ gee from the K@@ hy@@ ber agency .
I have come from a place of intense darkness .
And that is why I want to ill@@ umin@@ ate the world .
My name is Pap@@ u@@ say .
My heart and drum beat as one .
If religion is the op@@ ium of the mas@@ ses , then for me , music is my one and only gan@@ ja .
A rising tide li@@ fts all boats .
And the rising tide of Indi@@ a's spectacular economic growth has lifted over 400 million Indians into a bu@@ oy@@ ant middle class .
But there are still over 6@@ 50 million Indians , Paki@@ stan@@ is , S@@ ri L@@ ank@@ ans , Bang@@ la@@ de@@ sh@@ is , Nep@@ al@@ ese , who remain washed up on the sh@@ ores of poverty .
Therefore as India and Pakistan , as you and I , it be@@ hoo@@ ves us to tran@@ sc@@ end our differences , to celebrate our di@@ versity , to leverage our common humanity .
Our collective vision at Na@@ ya Je@@ e@@ van , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means " new life " in Ur@@ du and Hin@@ di , is to re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ate the lives of millions of low income families by provi@@ ding them with aff@@ ord@@ able access to cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c health care .
Indeed it is the emer@@ ging world's first H@@ M@@ O for the ur@@ ban working poor .
Why should we do this as Indians and Paki@@ stan@@ is ?
We are but two th@@ reads cut from the same cloth .
And if our f@@ ates are inter@@ twin@@ ed , then we believe that it is good kar@@ ma , it is good fortune .
And for many of us , our fortun@@ es do indeed lie at the bottom of the py@@ ram@@ id . Thank you .
( Applause ) Chris Ander@@ son@@ : Fantastic . Just stay up here .
That was fantastic .
I found that really moving .
You know , we fought hard to get at least a small Paki@@ stan@@ i contin@@ gent to come .
It felt like it was really important .
They went through a lot to get here .
Would the Paki@@ stan@@ is please just stand up please ?
I just really wanted to acknowledge you .
( Applause ) Thank you so much .
So , imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , " Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? "
And you say , " I'm sorry , well , this is O@@ ak Street , that's El@@ m Street .
This is 2@@ 6th , that's 2@@ 7th . "
He says , " OK , but what is the name of that block ? "
You say , " Well , blocks don't have names .
Stre@@ ets have names ; blocks are just the un@@ named spac@@ es in between streets . "
He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
So , now imagine you're standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , " Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? "
They say , " Oh , well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16 . "
And you say , " OK , but what is the name of this street ? "
And they say , " Well , streets don't have names .
Blocks have names .
Just look at Google Ma@@ ps here . There's Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the un@@ named spac@@ es in between the blocks .
And you say then , " OK , then how do you know your home address ? "
He said , " Well , easy , this is District Eight .
There's Block 17 , house number one . "
You say , " OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order . "
He says , " Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Third is house number three . It's easy . It's obvious . "
So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assu@@ mp@@ tions we didn't even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you're healthy , not sick .
( Applause ) In most music , we think of the " one " as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phr@@ as@@ e: one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the " one " is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the phr@@ asing , but the way they count off their mus@@ ic@@ : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accurate .
( Laughter ) There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let's never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .
Dom@@ o ar@@ iga@@ to go@@ za@@ im@@ ash@@ ita .
I have a daughter , Mul@@ an .
And when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about fro@@ gs .
And we were at this restaurant , and she said , " So , basically , fro@@ gs lay eggs and the eggs turn into ta@@ d@@ pol@@ es , and ta@@ d@@ pol@@ es turn into fro@@ gs . "
And I said , " Yeah . You know , I'm not really up on my frog re@@ production that much .
It's the fe@@ males , I think , that lay the eggs , and then the males fer@@ tili@@ ze them .
And then they become ta@@ d@@ pol@@ es and fro@@ gs . "
And she says , " What ? Only the fe@@ males have eggs ? "
And I said , " Yeah . "
And she goes , " And what's this fer@@ tili@@ zing ? "
So I kind of said , " Oh , it's this extra ingre@@ dient , you know , that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog . " ( Laughter ) And she said , " Oh , so is that true for humans too ? "
And I thought , " Okay , here we go . "
I didn't know it would happen so quick , at eight .
I was trying to remember all the gu@@ ide@@ books , and all I could remember was , " Only answer the question they're asking .
Don't give any more information . " ( Laughter ) So I said , " Yes . "
And she said , " And where do , um , where do human women , like , where do women lay their eggs ? "
And I said , " Well , funny you should ask . ( Laughter ) We have evolved to have our own pond .
We have our very own pond inside our bodies .
And we lay our eggs there , we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that .
It's our own pond . And that's how it happens . "
And she goes , " Then how do they get fer@@ tili@@ zed ? "
And I said , " Well , Men , through their penis , they fer@@ tili@@ ze the eggs by the sperm coming out .
And you go through the woman's vagina . "
And so we're just eating , and her jaw just drops , and she goes , " Mom !
Like , where you go to the bathroom ? "
And I said , " I know .
I know . "
( Laughter ) That's how we evolved . It does seem odd .
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an am@@ use@@ ment park . . .
Bad z@@ oning , but . . . " ( Laughter ) She's like , " What ? " And she goes , " But Mom , but men and women can't ever see each other naked , Mom .
So how could that ever happen ? "
And then I go , " Well , " and then I put my Margaret M@@ ead hat on .
" Human males and fe@@ males develop a special bond , and when they're much older , much , much older than you , and they have a very special feeling , then they can be naked together . "
And she said , " Mom , have you done this before ? "
And I said , " Yes . "
And she said , " But Mom , you can't have kids . "
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids .
And I said , " Yes . "
And she said , " Well , you don't have to do that again . "
And I said , " . . . "
And then she said , " But how does it happen when a man and woman are together ?
Like , how do they know that's the time ?
Mom , does the man just say , '@@ Is now the time to take off my pants ? ' " ( Laughter ) And I said , " Yes . "
( Laughter ) " That is exactly right .
That's exactly how it happens . "
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window , and she goes , " Mom . What if two just people saw each other on the street , like a man and a woman , they just started doing it . Would that ever happen ? "
And I said , " Oh , no . Hum@@ ans are so private .
Oh . . . "
And then she goes , " What if there was like a party , and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys , and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it , Mom ?
Would that ever happen ? "
And I said , " Oh , no , no .
That's not how we do it . "
Then we got home and we see the cat . And she goes , " Mom , how do cats do it ? "
And I go , " Oh , it's the same . It's basically the same . "
And then she got all caught up in the legs . " But how would the legs go , Mom ?
I don't understand the legs . "
She goes , " Mom , everyone can't do the spl@@ its . "
And I go , " I know , but the legs . . . "
and I'm probably like , " The legs get worked out . "
And she goes , " But I just can't understand it . "
So I go , " You know , why don't we go on the Internet , and maybe we can see . . . like on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia . " ( Laughter ) So we go online , and we put in " cats ma@@ ting . "
And , unfortunately , on YouTube , there's many cats ma@@ ting videos .
And we watched them and I'm so thankful , because she's just like , " Wow ! This is so amazing . "
She goes , " What about dogs ? "
So we put in dogs ma@@ ting , and , you know , we're watching it , and she's totally absor@@ bed .
And then she goes , " Mom , do you think they would have , on the Internet , any humans ma@@ ting ? "
( Laughter ) And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year ol@@ d's hand , and taken her right into Internet porn . ( Laughter ) And I looked into this trusting , loving face , and I said , " Oh , no .
That would never happen . "
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . I'm so happy to be here .
Last year here at TED I asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the web , on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data , scientific data , community data , whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imagined .
So , today I'm back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement af@@ oot , now , around the world .
The cry of " Ra@@ w data now ! "
which I made people make in the au@@ dit@@ orium , was heard around the world .
So , let's roll the video .
A classic story , the first one which lots of people picked up , was when in March -- on March 10@@ th in fact , soon after TED -- Paul Clarke , in the U . K . government , blo@@ gged , " Oh , I've just got some raw data . Here it is , it's about bicycle accidents . "
Two days it took the Times On@@ line to make a map , a mas@@ ha@@ ble map -- we call these things m@@ ash@@ -ups -- a mas@@ he@@ d-up user inter@@ face that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected .
Here's more data , traffic survey data , again , put out by the U . K . government , and because they put it up using the Lin@@ ked Data standards , then a user could just make a map , just by cli@@ cking .
Does this data affect things ? Well , let's get back to 2008 .
Look at Z@@ an@@ es@@ ville , Ohio .
Here's a map a lawyer made . He put on it the water plant , and which houses are there , which houses have been connected to the water .
And he got , from other data sources , information to show which houses are occupied by white people .
Well , there was too much of a cor@@ relation , he felt , between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water , and the judge was not impressed either .
The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10 . 9 million dollars .
That's the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , putting it together , and showing the result .
Let's look at some data from the U . K . now .
This is U . K . government data , a completely independent site , Where Does My Money Go .
It allows anybody to go there and bur@@ row down .
You can bur@@ row down by a particular type of spending , or you can go through all the different regi@@ ons and compare them .
So , that's happening in the U . K . with U . K . government data .
Yes , certainly you can do it over here .
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California .
Take an ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary example , Long Beach , California , you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy .
In fact , this is the graph of the number of data sets in the re@@ po@@ sit@@ ories of data . go@@ v , and data . go@@ v . u@@ k .
And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U . K . in blue , and the U . S . in red .
How can you use this stuff ?
Well , for example , if you have lots of data about places you can take , from a post@@ code -- which is like a zip plus four -- for a specific group of houses , you can make paper , print off a paper which has got very , very specific things about the bus stops , the things specifically near you .
On a larger scale , this is a m@@ ash@@ -up of the data which was released about the Af@@ g@@ han ele@@ ctions .
It allows you to set your own c@@ rit@@ eria for what sort of things you want to look at .
The red circles are poll@@ ing stations , sele@@ cted by your c@@ rit@@ eria .
And then you can sele@@ ct also other things on the map to see what other fa@@ ctors , like the threat level .
So , that was government data .
I also talked about commun@@ ity-@@ gener@@ ated data -- in fact I ed@@ ited some .
This is the wi@@ ki map , this is the Open Street Ma@@ p .
" Ter@@ race Theater " I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year .
I was not the only person ed@@ iting the open street map .
Each flash on this visu@@ ali@@ zation -- put together by IT@@ O World -- shows an ed@@ it in 2009 made to the Open Street Ma@@ p .
Let's now spin the world during the same year .
Every flash is an ed@@ it . Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Ma@@ p , and reali@@ zing it could be better .
You can see Europe is ab@@ la@@ ze with up@@ dates .
Some places , perhaps not as much as they should be .
Here foc@@ using in on Ha@@ iti .
The map of Port au@@ -@@ Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be , not as good as the map of California .
Fortunately , just after the earthquake , Ge@@ o@@ Eye , a commercial company , released satellite ima@@ gery with a license , which allowed the op@@ en-@@ source community to use it .
This is January , in time lapse , of people ed@@ iting . . . that's the earthquake .
After the earthquake , immediately , people all over the world , ma@@ ppers who wanted to help , and could , looked at that ima@@ gery , built the map , quickly building it up .
We're foc@@ using now on Port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ Prince .
The light blue is refu@@ gee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [ satellite images ] .
So , now we have , immediately , a re@@ al-@@ time map showing where there are refu@@ gee camps -- rapi@@ dly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ Prince .
Wit@@ ness the fact that it's here on this Gar@@ min device being used by rescue team in Ha@@ iti .
There's the map showing , on the le@@ ft-@@ hand side , that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship .
This is a re@@ al-@@ time map that shows blocked roads , damaged buildings , refu@@ gee camps -- it shows things that are needed [ for rescue and relief work ] .
So , if you've been involved in that at all , I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing , whether you've just been chan@@ ting , " Ra@@ w data now ! "
or you've been putting government or scientific data online , I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much , and we have only just started !
( Applause ) Please close your eyes , and open your hands .
Now imagine what you could place in your hand@@ s: an apple , maybe your wallet .
Now open your eyes .
What about a life ?
What you see here is a pre@@ mature baby .
He looks like he's resting peace@@ fully , but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regu@@ late his own body temperature .
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm .
Sa@@ dly , 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world .
Four million of these babies die ann@@ ually .
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe , long-@@ term health problems .
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life , its only job is to grow .
If it's batt@@ ling hypo@@ ther@@ mia , its organs can't develop normally , resul@@ ting in a range of health problems from dia@@ betes , to heart disease , to low I . Q .
Ima@@ gin@@ e: Many of these problems could be prevent@@ ed if these babies were just kept warm .
That is the primary function of an in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator .
But traditional in@@ cu@@ b@@ ators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars .
So , you're not going to find them in ru@@ ral areas of developing countries .
As a result , parents resort to local solu@@ tions like t@@ ying hot water bottles around their bab@@ ie@@ s' bodies , or pla@@ cing them under light bul@@ bs like the ones you see here -- methods that are both in@@ effective and un@@ safe .
I've seen this fir@@ sth@@ and over and over again .
On one of my first trips to India , I met this young woman , Se@@ vi@@ tha , who had just given birth to a tiny pre@@ mature baby , Ran@@ i .
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic , and the doctor advised her to take Ran@@ i to a city hospital so she could be placed in an in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator .
But that hospital was over four hours away , and Se@@ vi@@ tha didn't have the means to get there , so her baby died .
In@@ spi@@ red by this story , and dozens of other similar stories like this , my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution , something that could work without electricity , that was simple enough for a mother or a mid@@ wife to use , given that the majority of bir@@ ths still take place in the home .
We needed something that was port@@ able , something that could be ster@@ ili@@ zed and re@@ used across multiple babies and something ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low-@@ cost , compared to the 20 , 000 dollars that an in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator in the U . S . costs .
So , this is what we came up with .
What you see here looks nothing like an in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator .
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby .
You can open it up completely . It's water@@ proof .
There's no se@@ ams inside so you can ster@@ ili@@ ze it very easily .
But the magic is in this p@@ ou@@ ch of wax .
This is a pha@@ se-@@ change material .
It's a wa@@ x-@@ like substance with a mel@@ ting point of human body temperature , 37 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us .
You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it mel@@ ts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time , after which you simply re@@ heat the p@@ ou@@ ch .
So , you then place it into this little pocket back here , and it creates a warm micro@@ -@@ environment for the baby .
Looks simple , but we've rei@@ ter@@ ated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors , mom@@ s and clin@@ ici@@ ans to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communi@@ ties .
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010 , and the target price point will be 25 dollars , less than 0 . 1 percent of the cost of a traditional in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator .
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
But the lon@@ ger-@@ term social impact is a redu@@ ction in population growth .
This seems counter@@ intu@@ i@@ tive , but turns out that as inf@@ ant mor@@ tality is reduced , population si@@ zes also decre@@ ase , because parents don't need to antici@@ pate that their babies are going to die .
We hope that the Em@@ bra@@ ce inf@@ ant warmer and other simple inno@@ va@@ tions like this represent a new tr@@ end for the future of technolo@@ gy@@ : simple , lo@@ c@@ alized , aff@@ ord@@ able solu@@ tions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
In de@@ signing this we followed a few basic principles .
We really tried to understand the end user , in this case , people like Se@@ vi@@ tha .
We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being bi@@ ased by what already exists .
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
In doing this , I believe we can truly bring technology to the mas@@ ses .
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warm@@ th of an Em@@ bra@@ ce .
So , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are un@@ intellig@@ ible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40 , 000 pages of regulations , total comple@@ x@@ ity , which has a drama@@ tically negative impact on our life .
If you're a veter@@ an coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a bli@@ zz@@ ard of paperwork to get your benefits ; if you're trying to get a small business loan , you face a bli@@ zz@@ ard of paperwork .
What are we going to do about it ? I define simp@@ li@@ city as a means to achie@@ ving clar@@ ity , transpar@@ ency and em@@ pathy , building humanity into communications .
I've been simp@@ li@@ fying things for 30 years .
I come out of the advertising and design business .
My focus is understanding you people , and how you inter@@ act with the government to get your benefits , how you inter@@ act with corpor@@ ations to decide whom you're going to do business with , and how you view br@@ ands .
So , very quickly , when President Obama said , " I don't see why we can't have a one-@@ page , plain English consu@@ mer credit agreement . "
So , I locked myself in a room , figured out the content , organized the document , and wrote it in plain English .
I've had this checked by the two top consu@@ mer credit lawyers in the country .
This is a real thing .
Now , I went one step further and said , " Why do we have to stick with the sto@@ d@@ gy lawyers and just have a paper document ? Let's go online . "
And many people might need help in com@@ putation .
Working with the Harvard Business School , you'll see this example when you talk about minimum pay@@ ment@@ : If you spent 62 dollars for a meal , the longer you take to pay out that loan , you see , over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents .
How about that ? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people ?
But it's going to work . It's more effective than just compu@@ ta@@ tional a@@ ids .
And what about terms like " over the limit " ?
Perhaps a ste@@ alth thing .
De@@ fine it in context . Tell people what it means .
When you put it in plain English , you almost force the institution to give the people a way , a de@@ fault out of that , and not put themselves at risk .
Pla@@ in English is about changing the content .
And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for I@@ B@@ M .
It's a grid , it's a calendar .
At such and such a date , I@@ B@@ M has responsibilities , you have responsibilities .
Rec@@ ei@@ ved very favor@@ ably by business .
And there is some good news to report today .
Each year , one in 10 ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers recei@@ ves a notice from the IR@@ S .
There are 200 million letters that go out .
Running through this typical letter that they had , I ran it through my simp@@ li@@ city lab , it's pretty un@@ intellig@@ ible .
All the parts of the document in red are not intellig@@ ible .
We looked at doing over 1 , 000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transa@@ ctions in plain English .
They have been tested in the laboratory .
When I run it through my lab , this he@@ at-@@ ma@@ pping shows everything is intellig@@ ible .
And the IR@@ S has introduced the program .
( Applause ) There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention .
There is a lot of discussion now about a consu@@ mer financial protection agency , how to man@@ date simp@@ li@@ city .
We see all this comple@@ x@@ ity .
It's in@@ cum@@ bent upon us , and this organization , I believe , to make clar@@ ity , transpar@@ ency and em@@ pathy a national priority .
There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate .
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agre@@ ements with ste@@ alth pro@@ visions and that are un@@ intellig@@ ible .
So , how are we going to change the world ?
Make clar@@ ity , transpar@@ ency and simp@@ li@@ city a national priority .
I thank you .
( Applause ) I'm going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that might seem a bit surprising because my full-@@ time work at the Foundation is mostly about vacc@@ ines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
The climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won't grow@@ : There will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support .
And that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certainty , it leads to un@@ rest .
So , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
Also , the price of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
Now , the price of energy has come down over time .
Really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
The coal revolution fu@@ eled the Industri@@ al Revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've seen a very rap@@ id dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that's why we have refriger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
And so , we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But , as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with CO@@ 2 .
CO@@ 2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on CO@@ 2 is actually a very straight@@ forward one .
If you sum up the CO@@ 2 that gets em@@ itted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effe@@ ct@@ s: the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the in@@ direct effects , in that the natural e@@ co@@ systems can't adjust to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get e@@ co@@ system collap@@ ses .
Now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO@@ 2 to what temperature will be and where the positive fe@@ ed@@ backs are , there's some un@@ certainty there , but not very much .
And there's certainly un@@ certainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several ti@@ mes@@ : Do we really have to get down to near zero ?
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
And the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
And so that's a big challenge .
It's very different than saying " We're a t@@ wel@@ ve-@@ foo@@ t-@@ high truck trying to get under a ten-@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . "
This is something that has to get to zero .
Now , we put out a lot of carbon dio@@ x@@ ide every year , over 26 billion tons .
For each American , it's about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it's less than one ton .
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
It's been constantly going up .
It's only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapi@@ dly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
This equ@@ ation has four fa@@ ctors , a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ ca@@ tion: So , you've got a thing on the left , CO@@ 2 , that you want to get to zero , and that's going to be based on the number of people , the services each person's using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO@@ 2 being put out per unit of energy .
So , let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
Probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
Now that's back from high school al@@ ge@@ bra , but let's take a look .
First , we've got population .
The world today has 6 . 8 billion people .
That's headed up to about nine billion .
Now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1 . 3 .
The second factor is the services we use .
This en@@ com@@ passes every@@ thing: the food we eat , clothing , TV , he@@ ating .
These are very good thin@@ gs@@ : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
And it's a great thing for this number to go up .
In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
Here we have a very basic servi@@ ce: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
And , in fact , these kids don't , so they're going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
Now , effici@@ ency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
We have something that's not going up .
Through various in@@ ven@@ tions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substanti@@ ally .
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
There are other services like how we make fer@@ tili@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we're optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
But for these first three fa@@ ctors now , we've gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won't cut it .
So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO@@ 2 put out per each unit of energy .
And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero ?
If you burn coal , no .
If you burn natural gas , no .
Almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emer@@ ging rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out CO@@ 2 .
And so , what we're going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy miracles .
Now , when I use the term " miracle , " I don't mean something that's impossible .
The micro@@ pro@@ cess@@ or is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
The Internet and its services are a miracle .
So , the people here have partici@@ pated in the creation of many miracles .
Usually , we don't have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
Usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don't .
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight tim@@ eline .
Now , I thought , " How could I really capture this ?
Is there some kind of natural illu@@ stration , some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here ? "
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjoyed that .
( Laughter ) It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that rele@@ asing fire@@ flies would be my contri@@ bution to the environment here this year .
So here we have some natural fire@@ flies .
I'm told they don't bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
( Laughter ) Now , there's all sorts of gi@@ mm@@ i@@ cky solu@@ tions like that one , but they don't really add up to much .
We need solu@@ tions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reli@@ ability , and , although there's many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
I've left out tide , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
Those may make some contri@@ bution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five , and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challen@@ ges .
Let's look first at the burning fo@@ ssi@@ l fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it's not , and that's to take all the CO@@ 2 , after you've burned it , going out the flu@@ e , press@@ ur@@ ize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full per@@ cen@@ tage , that will be very tricky , and agre@@ eing on where these CO@@ 2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the toug@@ hest one here is this long-@@ term issue .
Who's going to be sure ?
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
This is a lot of volume .
So that's a tough one .
Next would be nuclear .
It also has three big proble@@ m@@ s: Co@@ st , particularly in highly regu@@ l@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons .
And then what do you do with the waste ?
And , although it's not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
People need to feel good about it .
So three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
The last three of the five , I've grou@@ ped together .
These are what people often refer to as the rene@@ w@@ able sources .
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disa@@ d@@ van@@ tages .
One is that the dens@@ ity of energy gathered in these technologies is drama@@ tically less than a power plant .
This is energy far@@ ming , so you're talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
Also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent sources .
The sun doesn't shine all day , it doesn't shine every day , and , like@@ wise , the wind doesn't blow all the time .
And so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time perio@@ ds that it's not available .
So , we've got big cost challen@@ ges here , we have transmission challen@@ ges@@ : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
And , finally , this storage problem .
And , to dimension@@ alize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flas@@ hl@@ ights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approa@@ ches we have now .
It's not impossible , but it's not a very easy thing .
Now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you're using .
If you're counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
Now , how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What's the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
In each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
And a lot of them , you'll look at and say , " They're crazy . " That's good .
And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursu@@ ing this .
Bill Gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called e@@ Sol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
Vin@@ od K@@ ho@@ sla@@ 's invest@@ ing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I'm trying to help back that .
Nathan My@@ hr@@ v@@ old and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surpri@@ sing@@ ly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
There are some inno@@ va@@ tions in nu@@ clear@@ : mo@@ dul@@ ar , liquid .
And inno@@ vation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
The idea of Ter@@ ra@@ Power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ anium -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , " Let's burn the 99 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 38 . "
It is kind of a crazy idea .
In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simu@@ late properly whether it would work or not , and so it's through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simu@@ late and see that , yes , with the right materi@@ al's approach , this looks like it would work .
And , because you're burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly improved cost profile .
You actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ fto@@ ver waste from today's rea@@ ctors .
So , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . It's a great thing .
It brea@@ thes this ur@@ anium as it goes along , so it's kind of like a candle .
You can see it's a log there , often re@@ ferred to as a traveling wave reactor .
In terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
This is the le@@ fto@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they've taken out the part they burn now , so it's called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ anium .
That would power the U . S . for hundreds of years .
And , simply by fil@@ tering se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , it's got lots of challen@@ ges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
So let's think@@ : How should we measure ourselves ?
What should our report card look like ?
Well , let's go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
For 20@@ 50 , you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agri@@ culture , hopefully we will have cleaned up for@@ est@@ ry , cement .
So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
So , the other grade is: Are we dep@@ lo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ em@@ ission technology , have we dep@@ lo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
That's super important .
That's a key element of making that report card .
So , backing up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two elements .
We should go through these effici@@ ency measures to start getting redu@@ ction@@ s: The less we e@@ mit , the less that sum will be of CO@@ 2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
But in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don't get us all the way to the big redu@@ ctions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of inno@@ vation on these break@@ through@@ s .
These break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regu@@ lat@@ ory things that have been changed .
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this .
The Al G@@ ore book , " Our Cho@@ ice " and the David McKay book , " Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able Ener@@ gy Without the Hot Air . "
They really go through it and create a fra@@ me@@ work that this can be discussed broad@@ ly , because we need broad backing for this .
There's a lot that has to come together .
So this is a wish .
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO@@ 2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick .
This is the one with the greatest impact .
If we don't get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U . S . and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
We need to go for more research fun@@ ding .
When countries get together in places like C@@ open@@ hagen , they shouldn't just discuss the CO@@ 2 .
They should discuss this inno@@ vation agenda , and you'd be stun@@ ned at the ri@@ dicul@@ ously low levels of spending on these inno@@ va@@ tive approa@@ ches .
We do need the market in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves -- CO@@ 2 tax , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
We need to get the message out .
We need to have this di@@ alogue be a more rational , more understand@@ able di@@ alogue , including the steps that the government takes .
This is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you .
Chris Ander@@ son@@ : Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . So to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ Power , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
B@@ il Gat@@ es: To actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hire all the great scientists , which we've done , that's only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regu@@ l@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
Once you get the first one built , if it works as adverti@@ sed , then it's just clear as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy dens@@ ity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
CA: And so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ anium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
B@@ G: That's right . Today , you're always refu@@ eling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wr@@ ong@@ : that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out , that's not good .
So , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it's done .
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
B@@ G: Yeah . Well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that's sitting in these cool@@ ing po@@ ols or dry c@@ asking by rea@@ ctors -- that's our fuel to begin with .
So , the thing that's been a problem from those rea@@ ctors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you're redu@@ cing the volume of the waste quite drama@@ tically as you're going through this process .
CA: I mean , you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G: Well , we haven't picked a particular place , and there's all these interesting disc@@ lo@@ sure rules about anything that's called " nuclear , " so we've got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China -- I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
So I'm optimi@@ stic . You know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It's an important advance , but it's like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
CA: So , in your mind , time@@ scale and li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
B@@ G: Well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that's very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to dep@@ loy .
That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
And , you know , Ter@@ ra@@ Power , if things go well -- which is wi@@ shing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
And there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , like@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fun@@ ding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
And it's best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
We certainly need one to succeed .
CA: In terms of big-@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you're aware of out there ?
B@@ G: An energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
In the nuclear space , there are other inno@@ vat@@ ors .
You know , we don't know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ dul@@ ar people , that's a different approach .
There's a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a mole@@ cule of ur@@ anium has a million times as much energy as a mole@@ cule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the nega@@ tives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
CA: If this doesn't work , then what ?
Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
B@@ G: If you get into that situation , it's like if you've been over-@@ eating , and you're about to have a heart atta@@ ck@@ : Then where do you go ? You may need heart surgery or something .
There is a line of research on what's called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would delay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that's just an insurance policy .
You hope you don't need to do that .
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
I'm not sure that's wise , given the importance of the problem , but there's now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this inno@@ vation goes a lot s@@ lower than we expect ?
CA: Cli@@ mate skep@@ tic@@ s: If you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they're wrong ?
B@@ G: Well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics come in different camps .
The ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
Are they saying that there's negative fe@@ ed@@ back effects that have to do with clouds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things .
The main problem we have here , it's kind of like AIDS .
You make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
And so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C report , that's not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , " OK , that isn't that big of a deal . "
The fact is it's that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
But my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ ints , then the skep@@ tics say , " OK , I don't care that it doesn't put out CO@@ 2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO@@ 2 , but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before . "
( Applause ) CA: And so , that would be your response to the Bj@@ orn Lom@@ borg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO@@ 2 problem , it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and mal@@ aria and so forth , it's a stupid waste of the Ear@@ th's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G: Well , the actual spending on the R & amp ; D piece -- say the U . S . should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that dramatic .
It shouldn't take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that's non-@@ economic and you're trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
Unless you're very close and you're just fun@@ ding the learning cur@@ ve and it's going to get very cheap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
If the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , " Let's make energy super expensive , " then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ festyle .
The disaster is for that two billion .
And even Lom@@ borg has changed .
His sh@@ tick now is , " Why isn't the R & amp ; D getting more discussed ? "
He's still , because of his earlier stuff , still associ@@ ated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp , and so , he's making the R & amp ; D point .
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
The R & amp ; D piece , it's crazy how little it's fun@@ ded .
CA: Well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much .
B@@ G: Thank you .
( Applause ) About a year ago , I asked myself a questi@@ on: " Knowing what I know , why am I not a veget@@ arian ? "
After all , I'm one of the green gu@@ y@@ s: I grew up with hipp@@ ie parents in a log cabin .
I started a site called Tre@@ e@@ Hu@@ gger -- I care about this stuff .
I knew that eating a mere ham@@ burger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third .
Cru@@ el@@ ty@@ : I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypo@@ cri@@ tically , wouldn't even consider for our own cats , dogs and other pets .
En@@ viron@@ mentally , meat , ama@@ z@@ ingly , causes more emi@@ ssions than all of transportation combin@@ ed@@ : cars , trains , planes , bus@@ es , boats , all of it .
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do .
I also knew that I'm not alone .
We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 5@@ 0s .
So what was once the special little side treat now is the main , much more regular .
So really , any of these ang@@ les should have been enough to convince me to go veget@@ arian .
Yet , there I was -- ch@@ k , ch@@ k , ch@@ k -- tu@@ cking into a big old steak .
So why was I st@@ alling ?
I realized that what I was being pit@@ ched was a bin@@ ary solution .
It was either you're a meat e@@ ater or you're a veget@@ arian , and I guess I just wasn't quite ready .
Imagine your last ham@@ burger .
( Laughter ) So my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste bu@@ ds .
And I'd commit to doing it later , and not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , later never came .
Sound familiar ?
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?
And I thought about it , and I came up with one .
I've been doing it for the last year , and it's great .
It's called week@@ day ve@@ g .
The name says it all@@ : Nothing with a face Monday through Friday .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
If you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major cul@@ pr@@ its in terms of environmental damage and health are red and proce@@ ssed me@@ ats .
So you want to swa@@ p those out with some good , susta@@ in@@ ably har@@ v@@ ested fish .
It's stru@@ ctured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it's okay to break it here and there .
After all , cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat in@@ take .
The program has been great , week@@ day ve@@ g .
My foot@@ prin@@ t's smaller , I'm le@@ ssen@@ ing poll@@ ution , I feel better about the animals , I'm even saving money .
Best of all , I'm heal@@ th@@ ier , I know that I'm going to live longer , and I've even lost a little weight .
So , please ask yourselves , for your health , for your po@@ cket@@ book , for the environment , for the anim@@ al@@ s: What's stopping you from giving week@@ day ve@@ g a shot ?
After all , if all of us ate half as much meat , it would be like half of us were veget@@ ari@@ ans .
Thank you .
( Applause ) So , now , there are a lot of web 2 . 0 consult@@ ants who make a lot of money .
In fact , they make their li@@ vings on this kind of stuff .
I'm going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes , so bear with me .
Star@@ ted a website back in 2005 , with a few friends of mine , called Re@@ dd@@ it . com .
That's what you'd call a social news website .
Basically all that means is that the democra@@ tic front page is the best stuff on the web . You find some interesting content , say a TE@@ D@@ Talk , submit it to Re@@ dd@@ it , and the community of your pe@@ ers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don't .
And that creates the front page . It's always rising , falling , always changing .
About a half million people visit every day . But this isn't about Re@@ dd@@ it .
This is actually about dis@@ covering new things that pop up on the web .
Because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of mem@@ es , all kinds of tr@@ ends get born right on our front page .
But this isn't even about Re@@ dd@@ it itself .
It's actually about hum@@ p@@ back w@@ hales .
Well , okay , technically it's actually about Green@@ peace , which is an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government on their w@@ hal@@ ing campaign .
These hum@@ p@@ back w@@ hales were getting killed .
They wanted to put an end to it . And one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these hum@@ p@@ back w@@ hales .
But to really kind of person@@ i@@ fy the movement , they wanted to name it .
So , in true web fashion they put together a p@@ oll where they had a bunch of very er@@ u@@ dite , very thoughtful , cul@@ tured names .
I believe this is a Far@@ si word for " immortal . "
I think this means " divine power of the ocean " in a Poly@@ ne@@ sian language .
And then there was this: Mister Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts .
( Laughter ) And this , this was special . Mister Pan@@ ts , or Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y , to his friends , was very popular on the Internet .
In fact , someone on Re@@ dd@@ it thought , " Oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . "
And , you know , Re@@ dd@@ itors respon@@ ded and all agreed .
So , the v@@ oting started and we actually got behind it ourselves .
We changed our lo@@ go , for the day , from the alien to a Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y , to sort of help the cause .
And it wasn't long before other sites like Far@@ k and Bo@@ ing Bo@@ ing and the rest of the Internet started saying , " Yes ! We love Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts . "
So , it went from about five percent , which was when this me@@ me started , to 70 percent at the end of v@@ oting .
Which is pretty impressive right ? We won ! Mister Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts was chosen . Hmm , just kidding . Okay .
So , Green@@ peace actually wasn't that crazy about it , because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win .
So they said , " No , no , just kidding . We'll give it another week of v@@ oting . "
Well , that got us a little angry .
So , we changed it to F@@ ight@@ in' Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y .
( Laughter ) And the Re@@ dd@@ it community , really , and the rest of the internet , rather , really got behind this .
Facebook groups were getting created . Facebook appli@@ cations were getting created .
The idea was , " Vo@@ te your conscience , " vote for Mister Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts .
And people were putting up signs in the real world -- ( Laughter ) -- about this whale .
And this was the final vote . When all was cleared . . .
78 percent of the votes , and to give you an idea of the land@@ slide , the next highest name pulled in three . Okay ?
So , there was a clear lesson here .
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts .
Which is obvious . It's a great name .
Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say , " Mister Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts . "
( Laughter ) And I think that's what helped drive this .
But what was cool was that the re@@ per@@ cu@@ ssions now for Green@@ peace was , they created an entire mark@@ eting campaign around it .
They sell Mister Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y Pan@@ ts shirts and p@@ ins .
They even created an e-@@ card so you could send your friend a dancing Sp@@ las@@ h@@ y .
But what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission . The Japanese government called off their w@@ hal@@ ing expedition . Mission accomplished .
Green@@ peace was thrilled . The w@@ hales were happy . That's a quote .
( Laughter ) And actually , Re@@ dd@@ itors in the Internet community were happy to participate , but they weren't whale lovers .
A few of them certainly were . But we're talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great me@@ me , and in fact someone from Green@@ peace came back on the site and than@@ ked Re@@ dd@@ it for its partici@@ pation .
But this wasn't really out of al@@ tru@@ ism . This was just out of interest in doing something cool .
And this is kind of how the Internet works .
This is that great big secret . Because the Internet provi@@ des this level playing field .
Your link is just as good as your link , which is just as good as my link . As long as we have a brow@@ ser , anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have .
That is , as long as you can keep net neutr@@ ality in place .
The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now .
There are so many great publi@@ shing tools that are available , it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something .
And the cost of iter@@ ation is so cheap that you might as well give it a go .
And if you do , be genuine about it . Be honest . Be up front .
And one of the great lessons that Green@@ peace actually learned was that it's okay to lose control .
It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously , given that , even though it's a very serious cause , you could ultimately achieve your final goal .
And that's the final message that I want to share with all of you -- that you can do well online .
But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down .
If you want to succeed you've got to be okay to just lose control .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Several years ago here at TED , Peter S@@ kill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ shmal@@ low challenge .
And the ide@@ a's pretty simp@@ le: Teams of four have to build the tal@@ lest fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of spa@@ ghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a mar@@ shmal@@ low .
The mar@@ shmal@@ low has to be on top .
And , though it seems really simple , it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I've condu@@ cted about 70 design work@@ shops across the world with students and design@@ ers and archite@@ cts , even the CT@@ O@@ s of the Fort@@ une 50 , and there's something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collabor@@ ation , and I'd like to share some of them with you .
So , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
They talk about it , they figure out what it's going to look like , they jo@@ ckey for power .
Then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ etch and they lay out spa@@ ghetti .
They spend the majority of their time assem@@ bling the sticks into e@@ ver-@@ growing stru@@ ctures .
And then finally , just as they're running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ shmal@@ low , and then they gin@@ ger@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-@@ da ! -- they admire their work .
But what really happens , most of the time , is that the " ta-@@ da " turns into an " uh-@@ oh , " because the weight of the mar@@ shmal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ckle and to collapse .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more " uh-@@ oh " moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
( Laughter ) They lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame stru@@ ctures .
And of course there are teams that have a lot more " ta-@@ da " stru@@ ctures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ garten .
( Laughter ) And it's pretty amazing .
As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tal@@ lest stru@@ ctures , but they're the most interesting stru@@ ctures of them all .
So the question you want to ask is: How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti , In@@ c . Right ?
They don't spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
But there's another reason as well .
And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
And then they execute on it .
And then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ shmal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
It's a crisis .
Sound familiar ? Right .
What kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ shmal@@ low , and they build proto@@ types , succe@@ ssive proto@@ types , always keeping the mar@@ shmal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build proto@@ types along the way .
Desig@@ ners recognize this type of collabor@@ ation as the essence of the iter@@ ative process .
And with each version , kids get instant fe@@ ed@@ back about what works and what doesn't work .
So the capacity to play in proto@@ type is really essential , but let's look at how different teams perform .
So the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
Who does the very best ?
Archite@@ cts and engine@@ ers , thank@@ fully .
( Laughter ) Thirty-@@ nine inches is the tal@@ lest structure I've seen .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ reinfor@@ cing ge@@ omet@@ rical patterns are the key to building stable stru@@ ctures .
So CE@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than average , but here's where it gets interesting .
If you put you put an executive ad@@ min . on the team , they get significan@@ tly better .
( Laughter ) It's incredible . You know , you look around , you go , " Oh , that team@@ 's going to win . "
You can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . And why is that ?
Because they have special skills of fac@@ il@@ itation .
They manage the process , they understand the process .
And any team who mana@@ ges and pays close attention to work will significan@@ tly improve the team@@ 's performance .
Speci@@ alized skills and fac@@ il@@ itation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
If you have 10 teams that typi@@ cally perform , you'll get maybe six or so that have standing stru@@ ctures .
And I tried something interesting .
I thought , let's up the ante , once .
So I offered a 10 , 000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
What was the result ?
Here's what happen@@ ed@@ : Not one team had a standing structure .
If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
So , isn't that interesting ? That high stakes have a strong impact .
We did the exercise again with the same students .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the value of proto@@ ty@@ ping .
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
They produced the tal@@ lest stru@@ ctures in the least amount of time .
So there's deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ c@@ enti@@ ves and success .
So , you might as@@ k: Why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ shmal@@ low challenge ?
And the reason is , I help create digital tools and proce@@ sses to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
And what the mar@@ shmal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
Because , frankly , every project has its own mar@@ shmal@@ low , doesn't it ?
The challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right proto@@ type .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ shmal@@ low@@ Chal@@ len@@ ge . com .
It's a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ shmal@@ lows .
There's ste@@ p-@@ by-@@ step instructions on this .
There are crazy examples from around the world of how people t@@ weak and adjust the system .
There's world records that are on this as well .
And the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
And sometimes , a little proto@@ type of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an " uh-@@ oh " moment to a " ta-@@ da " moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
( Applause ) One day , Los Angeles Times colum@@ n@@ ist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
And the source was a man , an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American man , charming , ru@@ gged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
And I'm telling a story that many of you know , because Ste@@ ve's colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Dow@@ ney Jr . acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Fo@@ x@@ x as Nathan@@ iel Anthony A@@ yers , the Ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ trained double bas@@ s@@ ist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic aff@@ li@@ ction with paranoid schi@@ zophren@@ ia .
Nathan@@ iel dropped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Ste@@ ve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you'll pardon the p@@ un -- in helping Nathan@@ iel get off the streets .
I met Mr . A@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Dis@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert Hall .
He had just heard a performance of Beetho@@ ven's First and Fourth symp@@ hon@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
He was speaking in a very jo@@ vial and gre@@ gar@@ ious way about Y@@ o-@@ Yo Ma and Hill@@ ary Clinton and how the Do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the World Ser@@ ies , all because of the trea@@ cher@@ ous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beetho@@ ven's Fourth Symp@@ hon@@ y .
And we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathan@@ iel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
Now , I should mention that Nathan@@ iel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thor@@ az@@ ine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
But as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schi@@ zophren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des , the worst of which can mani@@ fest themselves as him explo@@ ding and then disappear@@ ing for days , wandering the streets of S@@ kid R@@ ow , exposed to its hor@@ rors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ashed upon him .
And Nathan@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at Walt Dis@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert Hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
And I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ da@@ ctic violin pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
( Laughter ) So , I just started playing .
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Viol@@ in Con@@ cer@@ to .
And as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occur@@ ring in Nath@@ ani@@ el's eyes .
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharma@@ ceu@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
And Nath@@ ani@@ el's man@@ ic rage was trans@@ formed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
And in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain sni@@ pp@@ ets of violin concer@@ tos which he then asked me to complete -- Men@@ del@@ ss@@ ohn , T@@ cha@@ ik@@ ov@@ sky , Si@@ bel@@ ius .
And we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven and Bra@@ h@@ ms , Bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the B@@ 's , from Bart@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pe@@ kka Sal@@ onen .
And I understood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ dic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
And through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , er@@ u@@ dite , brilliant , Ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ trained musician .
Music is medicine . Music changes us .
And for Nathan@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
Because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ usions and shape them through his imagination and his crea@@ tivity , into reality .
And that is an escape from his tor@@ mented state .
And I understood that this was the very essence of art .
This was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our crea@@ tivity , we're able to shape those emotions into reality .
And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , in@@ spir@@ es and un@@ ites us .
And for Nathan@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
The rede@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musici@@ ans that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
And I will always make music with Nathan@@ iel , whether we're at Walt Dis@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert Hall or on S@@ kid R@@ ow , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
Thank you .

( Applause ) Robert G@@ up@@ ta@@ : I'm going to play something that I sha@@ m@@ eless@@ ly stole from cel@@ li@@ sts .
So , please forgive me .
( Laughter ) ( Music ) ( Applause ) I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California .
Just think about this problem for a second .
Here is a l@@ ump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand .
But it can con@@ tem@@ plate the va@@ st@@ ness of inter@@ stell@@ ar space .
It can con@@ tem@@ plate the meaning of infin@@ ity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of God .
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
It's the greatest mystery confron@@ ting human bein@@ gs@@ : How does this all come about ?
Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neur@@ ons .
We're looking at neur@@ ons here .
There are 100 billion neur@@ ons in the adult human brain .
And each neur@@ on makes something like 1 , 000 to 10 , 000 contacts with other neur@@ ons in the brain .
And based on this , people have calcul@@ ated that the number of per@@ mu@@ tations and combin@@ ations of brain activity exce@@ eds the number of elem@@ entary particles in the universe .
So , how do you go about studying the brain ?
One approach is to look at patients who had le@@ sions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
This is what I spoke about in the last TED .
Today I'll talk about a different approach , which is to put electro@@ des in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
Sort of ea@@ ves@@ drop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
Now , one recent discovery that has been made by re@@ sear@@ chers in Italy , in Par@@ ma , by Gi@@ a@@ com@@ o Ri@@ zz@@ ol@@ atti and his colleagues , is a group of neur@@ ons called mirror neur@@ ons , which are on the front of the brain in the fron@@ tal lo@@ bes .
Now , it turns out there are neur@@ ons which are called ordinary motor command neur@@ ons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years .
These neur@@ ons will fire when a person per@@ forms a specific action .
For example , if I do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neur@@ on in the front of my brain will fire .
If I reach out and pull an object , another neur@@ on will fire , comm@@ anding me to pull that object .
These are called motor command neur@@ ons that have been known for a long time .
But what Ri@@ zz@@ ol@@ atti found was a sub@@ set of these neur@@ ons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action .
So , here is a neur@@ on that fires when I reach and grab something , but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grab@@ bing something .
And this is truly ast@@ on@@ ishing .
Because it's as though this neur@@ on is adop@@ ting the other person's point of view .
It's almost as though it's performing a virtu@@ al reality simu@@ lation of the other person's action .
Now , what is the significan@@ ce of these mirror neur@@ ons ?
For one thing they must be involved in things like im@@ itation and em@@ ulation .
Because to imit@@ ate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view .
So , this is important for im@@ itation and em@@ ulation .
Well , why is that important ?
Well , let's take a look at the next slide .
So , how do you do im@@ itation ? Why is im@@ itation important ?
Mir@@ ror neur@@ ons and im@@ itation , em@@ ulation .
Now , let's look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture .
If you go back in time about [ 75 , 000 ] to 100 , 000 years ago , let's look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75 , 000 years ago .
And that is , there is a sudden emer@@ gen@@ ce and rap@@ id spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shel@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpre@@ t that person's behavior .
All of that happened rela@@ tively quickly .
Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100 , 000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly .
And I claim that what happened was the sudden emer@@ gen@@ ce of a sophisticated mirror neur@@ on system , which allowed you to em@@ u@@ late and imit@@ ate other people's actions .
So that when there was a sudden acci@@ dental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapi@@ dly , horiz@@ on@@ t@@ ally across the population , or was transm@@ itted ver@@ tically , down the generations .
So , this made evolution suddenly Lam@@ ar@@ ck@@ ian , instead of Dar@@ win@@ ian .
Dar@@ win@@ ian evolution is slow ; it takes hundreds of thousands of years .
A pol@@ ar bear , to evol@@ ve a coat , will take thousands of generations , maybe 100 , 000 years .
A human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another pol@@ ar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . What the pol@@ ar bear took 100 , 000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes .
And then once it's learned this it sp@@ reads in ge@@ omet@@ ric pro@@ portion across a population .
This is the basis . The im@@ itation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization .
Now there is another kind of mirror neur@@ on , which is involved in something quite different .
And that is , there are mirror neur@@ ons , just as there are mirror neur@@ ons for action , there are mirror neur@@ ons for touch .
In other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neur@@ on in the som@@ at@@ o@@ sensor@@ y cor@@ tex in the sensor@@ y region of the brain fires .
But the same neur@@ on , in some cases , will fire when I simply watch another person being touched .
So , it's em@@ path@@ i@@ zing the other person being touched .
So , most of them will fire when I'm touched in different lo@@ cations . Different neur@@ ons for different lo@@ cations .
But a sub@@ set of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
So , here again you have neur@@ ons which are en@@ rolled in em@@ pathy .
Now , the question then ari@@ se@@ s: If I simply watch another person being touched , why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sen@@ sation merely by watching somebody being touched ?
I mean , I em@@ path@@ ize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch .
Well , that's because you've got recep@@ tors in your skin , touch and pain recep@@ tors , going back into your brain and saying " Don't worry , you're not being touched .
So , em@@ path@@ ize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you'll get confused and mu@@ ddled . "
Okay , so there is a fe@@ ed@@ back signal that vet@@ oes the signal of the mirror neur@@ on prevent@@ ing you from consci@@ ously experiencing that touch .
But if you remove the arm , you simply an@@ esthe@@ ti@@ ze my arm , so you put an inje@@ ction into my arm , an@@ esthe@@ ti@@ ze the bra@@ chi@@ al ple@@ xus , so the arm is num@@ b , and there is no sen@@ sations coming in , if I now watch you being touched , I literally feel it in my hand .
In other words , you have dissol@@ ved the barrier between you and other human beings .
So , I call them Gand@@ hi neur@@ ons , or em@@ pathy neur@@ ons .
( Laughter ) And this is not in some abstra@@ ct metap@@ hor@@ ical sense .
All that's separ@@ ating you from him , from the other person , is your skin .
Remo@@ ve the skin , you experience that person's touch in your mind .
You've dissol@@ ved the barrier between you and other human beings .
And this , of course , is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , alo@@ of from other human beings , inspe@@ cting the world , inspe@@ cting other people .
You are , in fact , connected not just via Facebook and Internet , you're actually quite literally connected by your neur@@ ons .
And there is whole chains of neur@@ ons around this room , talking to each other .
And there is no real distin@@ cti@@ veness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness .
And this is not mum@@ bo@@ -@@ jum@@ bo philosophy .
It emer@@ ges from our understanding of basic neuro@@ science .
So , you have a patient with a phan@@ tom limb . If the arm has been removed and you have a phan@@ tom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phan@@ tom .
Now the ast@@ on@@ ishing thing is , if you have pain in your phan@@ tom limb , you squeeze the other person's hand , massage the other person's hand , that rel@@ ie@@ ves the pain in your phan@@ tom hand , almost as though the neur@@ on were ob@@ taining relief from merely watching somebody else being massa@@ ged .
So , here you have my last slide .
For the lon@@ gest time people have regar@@ ded science and hum@@ ani@@ ties as being distin@@ ct .
C . P . Snow spoke of the two cul@@ tu@@ re@@ s: science on the one hand , hum@@ ani@@ ties on the other ; never the t@@ wa@@ in shall meet .
So , I'm saying the mirror neur@@ on system under@@ lies the inter@@ face allowing you to re@@ think about issues like consciousness , represen@@ tation of self , what separ@@ ates you from other human beings , what allows you to em@@ path@@ ize with other human beings , and also even things like the emer@@ gen@@ ce of culture and civilization , which is unique to human beings . Thank you .
( Applause ) For some time I have been interested in the pla@@ ce@@ bo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , " Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . "
In other words , sugar pills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the pla@@ ce@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharma@@ ceu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the pla@@ ce@@ bo effect .
Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perc@@ eption of it .
In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ mentary , very simple magic trick .
And I'm going to show you how it works . This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
I learned it myself from Cu@@ b Scout Magic in the 197@@ 0s .
I'll do it for you , and then I'll explain it .
And then I'll explain why I explained it .
So , here's what happens .
The knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
I'll get my slee@@ ve back .
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my slee@@ ve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
That way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as I'm squee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my slee@@ ve .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magne@@ tism will hold the knife .
In fact it's held so tigh@@ tly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
Nothing goes up or down my slee@@ ve , no tri@@ ck@@ ery . And you can examine everything .
Ta-@@ da !
( Applause ) So , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ eption by studying this very -- even though it's a very simple trick meth@@ od@@ ologi@@ cally .
Probably many of you in the room know this trick .
What happens is this .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my slee@@ ve , that is a lie .
The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion .
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my in@@ dex finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
Nice one .
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there .
( Laughter ) So , it goes like this , from here , right .
And as I move around my finger shifts .
And we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it proce@@ sses information , it doesn't count , one , two , three . It groups them .
But that's not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up .
Obviously it's cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tism , but by chi@@ can@@ ery , my in@@ dex finger being there .
And then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . You give the knife out .
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . Thanks .
Now , ( Laughter ) what does that have to do with the pla@@ ce@@ bo effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
I'm not a doctor or a re@@ sear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ishing thing .
It turns out that if you ad@@ minister a pla@@ ce@@ bo in the form of a white pill , that's like aspirin shaped -- it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
But if you change the form that you give the pla@@ ce@@ bo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
Even though neither one of these things has any pharma@@ ceu@@ tical -- they're sugar pills .
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
What ? ( Laughter ) That really fli@@ pped me out .
Turns out though , that that's not even where it stops .
If you have cap@@ su@@ les , they're more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
A colored cap@@ su@@ le , that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
Do@@ sage has something to do with this .
One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don't remember the stati@@ stic now . Sorry .
But the point is . . .
( Laughter ) . . . these do@@ sages have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ultimate in pla@@ ce@@ bo , you've go to the needle .
Right ? A sy@@ ringe with some in@@ ert -- a couple CC@@ s of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ ject this into a patient . . .
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it's so much stronger than the white pill .
It's a really , this graph , well I'll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the needle .
And none of it has any real pharma@@ ceu@@ tical quality , it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
And we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
This is a seven@@ -@@ inch hat@@ pin . It's very , very sharp , and I'm going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
This is really my flesh . This is not Dami@@ an's speci@@ al-@@ grown flesh .
That's my skin right there . This is not a Hollywood special effect .
I'm going to pier@@ ce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
If you're que@@ asy -- ( Laughs ) if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn't know , and one woman almost passed out .
So , I suggest if you get que@@ asy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I'll do the first bad part behind it .
You'll get to see , you can look away too if you'd like to .
So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pier@@ ce .
I'm sorry , man . Am I freaking you out ?
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
( Laughter ) Sort of .
But you can't count my fingers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That's one , two three , four , five .
Yes , well . . .
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , " Well , he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
So , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
How's that look out there ? Pretty good .
( Laughs ) Yeah , I know . ( Laughs ) And the people in the back go , " OK , I didn't really see that . "
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
Let me give you good close look at this .
That really is my skin . That is not a Hollywood special effect .
That's my flesh , and I can twist that around .
I'm sorry . If you're getting que@@ asy , look away , don't look at the thing .
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , " Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
( Laughter ) Yes , there it is .
( Applause ) ( Laughter ) Normally now , I would take the needle out .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wounds .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I'm just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
( Laughter ) I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you're looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Hello , everyone . Because this is my first time at TED , I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit .
Yes . That's right . This is Barbie .
She's 50 years old . And she's looking as young as ever .
( Laughter ) But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an un@@ familiar face .
This is F@@ ull@@ a . F@@ ull@@ a is the Arab world's answer to Barbie .
Now , according to pro@@ pon@@ ents of the clas@@ h of civili@@ zations , Barbie and F@@ ull@@ a occup@@ y these completely separate sp@@ her@@ es .
They have different interests . They have diver@@ gent values .
And should they ever come in contact . . .
well , I've got to tell you , it's just not going to be pretty .
My experience , however , in the Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c world is very different .
Where I work , in the Arab region , people are busy taking up Western inno@@ va@@ tions and changing them into things which are neither conven@@ tionally Western , nor are they tradi@@ tionally Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c .
I want to show you two examples .
The first is 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b .
It means " for youth " and it's a new Arab TV channel .
( Video ) : Video cli@@ ps from across the glo@@ be .
The USA .
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone , if Allah is by my side ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ Everything will be all right ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ The Arab world .
( Music ) ♫ She was pre@@ served by mo@@ dest@@ y of the religion ♫ ♫ She was ad@@ or@@ ned by the light of the Q@@ ur@@ an ♫ Sher@@ een El Fe@@ ki@@ : 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b has been du@@ b@@ bed Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c M@@ TV .
Its cre@@ ator , who is an Egyp@@ tian TV producer called Ah@@ med Abu Ha@@ ï@@ ba , wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives .
He reck@@ ons the best way to get that message across is to use the enor@@ m@@ ously popular medium of music videos .
4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b was set up as an alternative to exi@@ sting Arab music channels .
And they look something like this .
( Music ) That , by the way is Ha@@ i@@ fa We@@ h@@ be . She's a Le@@ ban@@ ese pop star and pan@@ -A@@ ra@@ b p@@ in-@@ up girl .
In the world of 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b , it's not about bump and gr@@ ind .
But it's not about fire and bri@@ m@@ stone either .
Its videos are intended to show a kinder , gent@@ ler face of Islam , for young people to deal with life's challen@@ ges .
Now , my second example is for a slightly younger crowd .
And it's called " The 99 . "
Now , these are the world's first Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c super@@ heroes .
They were created by a Ku@@ wait@@ i psych@@ ologist called Na@@ if Al Mu@@ ta@@ wa .
And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of int@@ oler@@ ance , all in a chil@@ d-@@ friendly form@@ at .
" The 99 . " The characters are meant to em@@ body the 99 at@@ tri@@ b@@ utes of Al@@ la@@ h@@ : justice , wisdom , mercy , among others .
So , for example , there is the character of No@@ ora .
She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone .
Another character called J@@ ami has the ability to create fantastic in@@ ven@@ tions .
Now , " The 99 " is not just a comic book .
It's now a theme park .
There is an ani@@ mated series in the works .
And by this time next year , the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with " The 99 " to beat in@@ justice wherever they find it .
" The 99 " and 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b are just two of many examples of this sort of Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c cross-@@ cultural hy@@ bri@@ di@@ zation .
We're not talking here about a clas@@ h of civili@@ zations .
Nor is it some sort of indi@@ stin@@ gu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble m@@ ash .
I like to think of it as a me@@ sh of civili@@ zations , in which the stran@@ ds of different cul@@ tures are inter@@ twin@@ ed .
Now , while 4@@ Sh@@ ba@@ b and " The 99 " may look new and shiny , there is actually a very long tradition of this .
Th@@ r@@ ough@@ out its history , Islam has borrowed and adap@@ ted from other civili@@ zations both ancient and modern .
After all , it's the Q@@ ur@@ an which encoura@@ ges us to do this: " We made you into nations and tri@@ bes so that you could learn from one another . "
And to my mind , those are pretty wise words , no matter what your cre@@ ed . Thank you .
( Applause ) Can ge@@ ogra@@ phic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
I found myself in a hospital in an inten@@ si@@ ve-@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emergency surgery .
And I suddenly realized some@@ thing: that I was completely in the dark .
I started asking my questions , " Well , why me ? "
" Why now ? " " Why here ? "
" Could my doctor have warned me ? "
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
Gene@@ tics , li@@ festyle and environment .
That's going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
Well , I understand the gene@@ tics and li@@ festyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physi@@ cians constantly ask me questions about this .
Have you ever had to fill out those long , leg@@ al-@@ size forms in your doctor's office ?
I mean , if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
( Laughter ) Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your li@@ festyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your aller@@ gy history . . . did I forget any history ?
But this part of the equ@@ ation I didn't really get , and I don't think my physi@@ cians really get this part of the equ@@ ation .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about@@ : How many places have you lived ?
Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
And if you're like me , you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
So , it's not really simple when somebody asks you , " Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see ? "
Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time rela@@ tively in a small number of places .
And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I'm an exten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker .
Now , I'm going to take you on a little journey here .
I started off in Sc@@ ran@@ ton , Pennsylvania .
I don't know if anybody might hail from north@@ ea@@ stern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
You know , breathing high concent@@ rations here of sul@@ fur dio@@ x@@ ide , carbon dio@@ x@@ ide and meth@@ ane gas , in un@@ equal quanti@@ ties -- 19 years of this .
And if you've been in that part of the country , this is what those pil@@ es of burning , sm@@ ol@@ dering coal waste look like .
So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-@@ west .
OK , so I ended up in Lou@@ is@@ ville , Kentucky .
Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Ru@@ b@@ ber@@ town .
They manu@@ fa@@ cture pla@@ stics . They use large quanti@@ ties chlor@@ op@@ ren@@ e and ben@@ z@@ ene .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my midd@@ le-@@ age lungs now , breathing various concent@@ rations of that .
And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
It was insi@@ dious and it was really happening .
Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
And I moved to Red@@ lands California .
Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with partic@@ u@@ late matter , carbon dio@@ x@@ ide and very high do@@ ses of o@@ zone .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
If you've been there , you know what I'm talking about .
So , what's wrong with this picture ?
Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
The one thing that never happens in my doctor's off@@ ic@@ e: They never ask me about my place history .
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , " Where have you lived ? "
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I in@@ gest into my stomach .
They really don't do that . It's missing .
Look at the kind of data that's available .
This dat@@ a's from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars invest@@ ing in this kind of research .
Now , I've cir@@ c@@ led the places where I've been .
Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places . Right ?
So , how many people are in the white ?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
Anybody ? Boy you're lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are disp@@ la@@ yed in at@@ las@@ es all over the world .
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck .
But none of that's in my medical record .
And it's not in yours either .
So , here's my friend Paul .
He's a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 3@@ 65 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
Anybody got any clues ? Sk@@ i . Right .
We can z@@ oom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
And all of those black do@@ ts are all of the toxic release invent@@ ories that are monit@@ ored by the EP@@ A .
Did you know that data existed ?
For every community in the United States , you could have your own person@@ alized map of that .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This is how Paul did it . He did it with his i@@ Phone .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
This could be my little asse@@ ss@@ ment .
And he looks at that and he says , " Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you're out here in beautiful California , and it's warm every day , that you get out and run at six o'clock at night .
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill , because of this report . "
What I'd like to leave you for are two prescri@@ p@@ tions .
Okay , number one is , we must teach physi@@ cians about the value of ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal information .
It's called ge@@ ome@@ di@@ cine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
And they're in the early stages of development .
These programs need to be suppor@@ ted , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today .
The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the re@@ sear@@ chers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
But it will also be useful for us .
I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the o@@ zone capital of the United States , couldn't I ? I could make that decision .
Or I could negotiate with my emplo@@ yer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what the conclusion of the Dar@@ t@@ mouth At@@ las of He@@ al@@ th@@ care was about , was saying that we can explain the ge@@ ogra@@ phic vari@@ ations that occur in disease , in illness , in well@@ ness , and how our heal@@ th@@ care system actually oper@@ ates .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
So , I'd very much like to see us begin to really sei@@ ze this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
So with that , I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of heal@@ th@@ : Ge@@ ography always matters .
And I believe that ge@@ ogra@@ phic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
( Applause ) We are drowning in news .
Reu@@ ters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year .
That's just one source .
My question is: How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?
That's the idea behind The Long News .
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation , which was founded by TE@@ D@@ sters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand .
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10 , 000 years from now .
And when you look at the news through that filter , a lot falls by the wa@@ y@@ side .
To take the top stories from the A . P . this last year , is this going to matter in a decade ?
Or this ?
Or this ?
Really ?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ?
Okay , that was kind of cool .
( Laughter ) But the top story of this past year was the economy , and I'm just betting that , sooner or later , this particular re@@ ce@@ ssion is going to be old news .
So , what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ?
Well , let's take science .
Someday , little robots will go through our blood@@ stre@@ ams fixing things .
That someday is already here if you're a mouse .
Some recent stor@@ ie@@ s: n@@ ano@@ bees za@@ p tum@@ ors with real bee ven@@ om ; they're sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body .
What about resources ? How are we going to feed nine billion people ?
We're having trouble feeding six billion today .
As we heard yesterday , there's over a billion people hungry .
Britain will starve without gene@@ tically modi@@ fied cro@@ ps .
Bill Gates , fortunately , has bet a billion on [ agri@@ cultural ] research .
What about global politics ?
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda , and they may .
They've over@@ taken the U . S . as the world's biggest car market , they've over@@ taken Germany as the largest ex@@ por@@ ter , and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their care@@ ers .
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know .
Some recent dis@@ cover@@ ie@@ s: There's an ant colony from Argentin@@ a that has now spread to every continent but Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tica ; there's a self-@@ directed robot scientist that's made a discovery -- soon , science may no longer need us , and life may no longer need us either ; a micro@@ be wakes up after 120 , 000 years .
It seems that with or without us , life will go on .
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this on@@ e: water found on the moon .
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
And if NASA doesn't do it , China might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
My point is this: In the long run , some news stories are more important than others .
( Applause ) In 2008 , Cy@@ cl@@ one Nar@@ g@@ is deva@@ stated My@@ an@@ mar .
Milli@@ ons of people were in severe need of help .
The U . N . wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cy@@ cl@@ one victims .
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was ma@@ pped to a ge@@ o-@@ co@@ d@@ able level of detail .
The U . N . ran head@@ first into a problem that the majority of the world's pop@@ ulous fac@@ es: not having deta@@ iled maps .
But help was coming .
At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120 , 000 kilometers of roads , 3 , 000 hospitals , logi@@ stics and relief points .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Ma@@ p@@ maker .
Google Ma@@ p@@ maker is a technology that em@@ powers each of us to map what we know lo@@ cally .
People have used this software to map everything from roads to ri@@ vers , from schools to local bus@@ ine@@ sses , and video stores to the corner store .
Ma@@ ps matter .
No@@ bel Pri@@ ze nomin@@ ee Her@@ n@@ ando De So@@ to recognized that the key to economic li@@ fto@@ ff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of un@@ cap@@ itali@@ zed land .
For example , a tri@@ lli@@ on dollars of real estate remains un@@ cap@@ itali@@ zed in India alone .
In the last year alone , thousands of us@@ ers in 1@@ 70 countries have ma@@ pped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought vi@@ able .
And this was made possible by the power of passionate us@@ ers everywhere .
Let's look at some of the maps being created by us@@ ers right now .
So , as we speak , people are ma@@ pping the world in these 1@@ 70 countries .
You can see Bridget in Africa who just ma@@ pped a road in Sen@@ egal .
And , closer to home , Chal@@ ua , an N . G . road in Bang@@ al@@ ore .
This is the result of compu@@ ta@@ tional ge@@ omet@@ ry , gesture recognition , and machine learning .
This is a victory of thousands of us@@ ers , in hundreds of cities , one user , one ed@@ it at a time .
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our un@@ ma@@ pped planet .
Welcome to the new world .
( Applause ) I only have three minutes so I'm going to have to talk fast , and it will use up your spare mental cy@@ cles , so multi@@ t@@ asking may be hard .
So , 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
I've had some time to think it over .
And energy effici@@ ency is more than just about the vehicle -- it's also about the road .
Road design makes a difference , particularly inter@@ se@@ ctions , of which there are two type@@ s: sign@@ alized and uns@@ ign@@ alized , which means stop signs .
Fifty percent of cr@@ ashes happen at inter@@ se@@ ctions .
R@@ ound@@ abouts are much better .
A study of 24 inter@@ se@@ ctions has found cr@@ ashes drop 40 percent from when you conver@@ t a traffic light into a r@@ ound@@ about .
In@@ jury cr@@ ashes have dropped 76 percent , fatal cr@@ ashes down 90 percent .
But that's just safety .
What about time and gas ?
So , traffic keeps flowing , so that means less bra@@ king , which means less acceler@@ ating , less gas and less poll@@ ution , less time wasted , and that part@@ ly accounts for Europ@@ e's better effici@@ ency than we have in the United States .
So , uns@@ ign@@ alized inter@@ se@@ ctions , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there's an exce@@ ssive pr@@ oli@@ fer@@ ation of them .
Small r@@ ound@@ abouts are starting to appear .
This is one in my neighborhood . And they are much better -- better than traffic lights , better than four-@@ way stop signs .
They're expensive to inst@@ all , but they are more expensive not to . So , we should look at that .
But they are not appli@@ cable in all situations .
So , take , for example , the three-@@ way inter@@ section .
So , it's logical that you'd have one there , on the minor road entering the major .
But the other two are somewhat questi@@ onable .
So , here's one . There's another one which I studied .
Car@@ s rarely appear on that third road .
And so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
That inter@@ section I looked at had about 3 , 000 cars per day in each direction , and so that's two oun@@ ces of gas to acceler@@ ate out of .
That's five cents each , and times 3 , 000 cars per day , that's $ 51 , 000 per year .
That's just the gasoline cost . There is also poll@@ ution , wear on the car , and time .
What's that time worth ?
Well , at 10 seconds per 3 , 000 cars , that's 8 . 3 hours per day . The average wage in the U . S .
is $ 20 an hour . That is 60 , 000 per year .
Ad@@ d that together with the gas , and it's $ 1@@ 12 , 000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
Dis@@ count that back to the present , at five per@@ cent@@ : over two million dollars for a stop sign , in each direction .
Now , if you look at what that ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent property is worth , you could actually buy the property , cut down the shr@@ u@@ b@@ bery to improve the sight line , and then sell it off again .
And you'd still come out ahead .
So , it makes one wonder , " Why is it there ? "
I mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ?
Because it is saving lives . So , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
The answer is to en@@ able cars to come in from that side road safely .
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long qu@@ eu@@ e could form because the cars aren't s@@ lowing down on the main road .
Can that be accomplished with exi@@ sting signs ?
So , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
Stop signs were invented in 19@@ 15 , yield signs in 19@@ 50 . But that's all we got .
So , why not use a yield sign ?
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right@@ -of-@@ way .
That means that if there are five cars waiting , you have to wait till they all go , then you go . It la@@ cks the notion of al@@ tern@@ ating , or taking turns , and it's always on the minor road , allowing the major one to have pri@@ ma@@ cy .
So , it's hard to create a new meaning for the exi@@ sting sign .
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone , " OK , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? Now do something different . "
That would not work .
So , what the world needs now is a new type of sign .
( Applause ) So , you'd have a little instru@@ ction below it , you know , for those who didn't see the public service announ@@ cements .
And it mer@@ ges the stop sign and yield signs .
It's kind of shaped like a T , as in taking turns .
And un@@ certainty results in caution .
When people come to an un@@ familiar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down .
So , now that you are all " Road Sch@@ ol@@ ars " . . .
( Laughter ) don't wait for that sign to be adopted , these things don't change quickly .
But you all are members of communi@@ ties , and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flo@@ ws .
And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Hi . For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears , these are the dancing bears .
In 199@@ 5 , we started working on a two-@@ year investig@@ ative research project to try and find out what was going on .
Because the slo@@ th bears in the wild were obviously getting de@@ ple@@ ted because of this .
This is the Q@@ al@@ and@@ ar community . They are a mar@@ gin@@ alized Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c community who live across India , and have been in India since the 13@@ th century .
We went about getting evidence of what was going on .
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button .
And we went in , pretending to be bu@@ yers .
And we found this right in this very state , in Kar@@ n@@ at@@ aka .
And the bear cu@@ bs were being har@@ v@@ ested from across the country and being sold and tra@@ ded .
These were being sold for about 2 , 000 dollars each , and they are used for bear pa@@ w soup , and also being trained , later on , to become dancing bears like the one you just saw .
Sa@@ dly , the family of Q@@ al@@ and@@ ars depen@@ ded on this bear .
The couple are barely 18 years old .
They already have four children beside them . You can see them .
And the economy of the family and their li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood depen@@ ded on those animals .
So , we had to deal with it in a very practical and susta@@ in@@ able manner .
Now , when we started working deeper and digging deeper , we found that it's an illegal act .
These guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities .
And what they were doing to the bears was really app@@ alling .
It was un@@ acceptable .
The mother bears are usually killed .
The cu@@ bs , which are taken , are separated .
Their teeth are basically bas@@ hed out with a metal rod .
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the mu@@ zzle .
Now we had to start changing these people and conver@@ ting them from using that for a li@@ vel@@ i@@ hood , to getting something else .
So , this is Bit@@ u Q@@ al@@ and@@ ar , who was our first experiment .
And we were so un@@ sure that this would work .
We weren't sure at all . And we managed to convince him .
And we said , " Okay , here is some seed fund .
Let's see if you can get something else . " And we got the bear sur@@ rendered to -- we set up a san@@ ctuary . We have four san@@ ctu@@ aries in India .
And now he sells cool drinks , he's by the highway .
He has a telephone booth .
And then it started , there was no turning back after that .
This is Sa@@ du@@ a who came and sur@@ rendered his bear .
And now he runs a cattle fo@@ dder store and a grain store near A@@ gra .
Then there was no looking back at all for us .
We gave cycle ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ ws .
We set up car@@ pet@@ -@@ wea@@ ving units , vo@@ ca@@ tional training for the women .
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with main@@ stream society . So , we were able to address that .
Edu@@ cation . The kids never went to school .
They only had Is@@ l@@ ami@@ c education , very little of it .
And they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra ear@@ ning hand at home . So we managed to get education .
So , we sponsor 600 children education programs today .
We were able to ensure br@@ ighter fut@@ ures for these people .
Of course we also had to get the bears in .
This is what happens to the bears when they come in .
And this is what we turn them into .
We have a veter@@ inary facility in our rescue cen@@ ters .
So , basically in 200@@ 2 there were 1 , 200 dancing bears .
We rescued over 5@@ 50 dancing bears .
We've been able to ensure better fut@@ ures for the people and the bears .
The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India , into our rescue center .
( Applause ) And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbar@@ ic practice which has been here for centuries .
And the people can hold their heads up high .
And the Q@@ al@@ and@@ ar people will rise above all this cruel barbar@@ ic past that they've lived all their lives .
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again .
And there will be no more re@@ moving of these bears .
And the children , both humans and bear cu@@ bs can live peace@@ fully . Thank you .
( Applause ) First of all , I'm a ge@@ ek .
I'm an organic foo@@ d-@@ eating , carbon foot@@ prin@@ t-@@ minim@@ i@@ zing , robo@@ tic surgery ge@@ ek .
And I really want to build green , but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-@@ meaning articles , people long on moral authority and short on data , telling me how to do these kinds of things .
And so I have to figure this out for myself .
For examp@@ le: Is this evil ?
I have dropped a blo@@ b of organic yo@@ gurt from happy self-@@ act@@ u@@ alized local cows on my counter top , and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up .
But can I use a paper towel ? ( Laughter ) The answer to this can be found in em@@ bo@@ died energy .
This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or em@@ bo@@ died water , and every time I use a paper towel , I am using this much virtu@@ al energy and water .
Wi@@ pe it up , throw it away .
Now , if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times , I don't have a whole lot of em@@ bo@@ died energy until I wash that yo@@ gur@@ ty towel .
This is now operating energy .
So if I throw my towel in the washing machine , I've now put energy and water back into that towel . . .
unless I use a fron@@ t-@@ loading , high-@@ effici@@ ency washing machine , ( Laughter ) and then it looks a little bit better .
But what about a recy@@ c@@ led paper towel that comes in those little half sheets ?
Well , now a paper towel looks better .
Screw the paper towels . Let's go to a spon@@ ge .
I wipe it up with a spon@@ ge , and I put it under the running water , and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water .
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on , and then you start to use more energy .
Or worse , you let it run until it's warm to rin@@ se out your towel .
And now all bets are off .
( Laughter ) So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimi@@ ze .
Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house .
( Laughter ) That's what my husband and I are doing right now .
And so , we wanted to know , how green could we be ?
And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green tra@@ de-@@ offs .
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimi@@ ze these little things around the ed@@ ges and missing the elephant in the living room .
Now , the average house has about 300 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hours of em@@ bo@@ died energy in it ; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels .
We wanted to know how much better we could do .
And so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom .
So first , we dem@@ ol@@ ish it .
It takes some energy , but if you de@@ constru@@ ct it -- you take it all apart , you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back .
We then dug a big hole to put in a rain@@ water cat@@ ch@@ ment tank to take our yard water independent .
And then we p@@ oured a big foundation for passi@@ ve solar .
Now , you can reduce the em@@ bo@@ died energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete .
We then put in fra@@ ming .
And so this is fra@@ ming -- l@@ umber , com@@ posi@@ te materials -- and it's kind of hard to get the em@@ bo@@ died energy out of that , but it can be a susta@@ in@@ able re@@ source if you use F@@ S@@ C-@@ cer@@ tified l@@ umber .
We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising .
If we put al@@ umin@@ um windows in this house , we would double the energy use right there .
Now , P@@ V@@ C is a little bit better , but still not as good as the wood that we chose .
We then put in plum@@ bing , electrical and H@@ V@@ A@@ C , and insu@@ late .
Now , spray fo@@ am is an excellent insul@@ ator -- it f@@ ills in all the cra@@ cks -- but it is pretty high em@@ bo@@ died energy , and , spra@@ ye@@ d-@@ in cell@@ u@@ lose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that .
We also used straw b@@ ale in@@ fill for our library , which has zero em@@ bo@@ died energy .
When it comes time to she@@ et@@ rock , if you use E@@ co@@ Rock it's about a quarter of the em@@ bo@@ died energy of standard she@@ et@@ rock .
And then you get to the fin@@ ishes , the subject of all of those " go green " articles , and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all .
And yet , all the press is focused on that .
Except for flo@@ oring .
If you put car@@ p@@ eting in your house , it's about a ten@@ th of the em@@ bo@@ died energy of the entire house , unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower em@@ bo@@ died energy .
So now we add in the final construction energy , we add it all up , and we've built a house for less than half of the typical em@@ bo@@ died energy for building a house like this .
But before we p@@ at ourselves too much on the back , we have p@@ oured 15@@ 1 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t hours of energy into constru@@ cting this house when there was a house there before .
And so the question is: How could we make that back ?
And so if I run my new ener@@ g@@ y-@@ efficient house forward , compared with the old , non-@@ ener@@ g@@ y-@@ efficient house , we make it back in about six years .
Now , I probably would have up@@ gra@@ ded the old house to be more ener@@ g@@ y-@@ efficient , and in that case , it would take me more about 20 years to break even .
Now , if I hadn't paid attention to em@@ bo@@ died energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the up@@ gra@@ ded house .
So what does this mean ?
On the scale of my portion of the house , this is equi@@ valent to about as much as I drive in a year , it's about five times as much as if I went entirely veget@@ arian .
But my elephant in the living room flies .
Clearly , I need to walk home from TED .
But all the calcu@@ lations for em@@ bo@@ died energy are on the blog .
And , remember , it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are .
Thank you . ( Applause ) I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wi@@ red .
I always keep my the@@ sau@@ rus handy whenever I'm writing anything , but I'd already finished ed@@ iting the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word " disabled " to see what I'd find .
Let me read you the entry .
" Di@@ sa@@ bled , ad@@ je@@ cti@@ ve@@ : cri@@ pp@@ led , helpless , useless , wre@@ cked , st@@ alled , ma@@ im@@ ed , wounded , man@@ gled , lame , mu@@ til@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n-@@ out , wea@@ kened , impo@@ tent , ca@@ strated , paraly@@ zed , handi@@ ca@@ pped , sen@@ ile , decre@@ pit , la@@ i@@ d-up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cra@@ ck@@ e@@ d-up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
Anton@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . "
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but I'd just gotten past " man@@ gled , " and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words un@@ le@@ ashed .
You know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old the@@ sau@@ rus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
But , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
And , nee@@ dless to say , thank God I wasn't using a the@@ sau@@ rus back then .
I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perc@@ ei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today I'm celebr@@ ated for the opportunities and advent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cured .
So , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online e@@ dition , expecting to find a re@@ vision worth no@@ ting .
Here's the up@@ dated version of this entry .
Unfortunately , it's not much better .
I find the last two words under " Ne@@ ar Anton@@ y@@ ms , " particularly un@@ sett@@ l@@ ing: " whole " and " wh@@ ole@@ some . "
So , it's not just about the words .
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
It's about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
Our language affe@@ cts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
In fact , many ancient so@@ cie@@ ties , including the Gre@@ eks and the Romans , believed that to utter a curse verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
So , what reality do we want to call into exi@@ sten@@ ce: a person who is limited , or a person who's em@@ powered ?
By cas@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and casting shadows on their power .
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead ?
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A . I . du@@ P@@ ont Institute in Wil@@ min@@ gton , Del@@ aware .
His name was Dr . Piz@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce , so he went by Dr . P .
And Dr . P always wore really col@@ or@@ ful bow ties and had the very perfect dispo@@ sition to work with children .
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy se@@ ssions .
I had to do what seemed like inn@@ um@@ er@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exercis@@ es with these thick , el@@ a@@ stic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
And , you know , I was already bar@@ gaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr . P to try to get out of doing these exercis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my session -- exhau@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these se@@ ssions -- and he said to me , " Wow . Ai@@ mee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you're going to break one of those bands .
When you do break it , I'm going to give you a hundred bucks . "
Now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on Dr . P@@ 's part to get me to do the exercis@@ es I didn't want to do before the prospe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est five-@@ year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effe@@ ctively did for me was re@@ shape an awful daily occur@@ r@@ ence into a new and promising experience for me .
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inher@@ ently strong , powerful and athle@@ tic person well into the future .
This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
But , in the previous inst@@ ances of those the@@ sau@@ rus ent@@ ries , our language isn't allowing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
Certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , laser surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ anium knees and hip repla@@ cements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has impo@@ sed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to claim their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ign with global groups of their own choosing .
So , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th@@ : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt is our greatest asset .
The human ability to ada@@ pt , it's an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ versity , and I'm going to make an admi@@ ssion@@ : This phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people's questions about it , and I think I'm starting to figure out why .
Imp@@ li@@ c@@ it in this phrase of " over@@ coming ad@@ versity " is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emer@@ ging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience uns@@ ca@@ thed or un@@ marked by the experience , as if my succe@@ sses in life have come about from an ability to side@@ step or circum@@ navig@@ ate the presu@@ med pit@@ falls of a life with pro@@ sthe@@ tics , or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my disa@@ bility .
But , in fact , we are changed . We are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing .
Ad@@ versity isn't an obsta@@ cle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
It's part of our life .
And I tend to think of it like my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there's very little , but it's always with me .
And , certainly , I'm not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person's struggle .
There is ad@@ versity and challenge in life , and it's all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet ad@@ versity , but how you're going to meet it .
So , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ versity , but preparing them to meet it well .
And we do a di@@ sser@@ vice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to ada@@ pt .
There's an important difference and distin@@ ction between the objective medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ tee and the subje@@ ctive so@@ cie@@ tal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled .
And , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consistent disa@@ bility I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those defin@@ i@@ tions .
In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disa@@ ble someone .
Perhaps the exi@@ sting model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disa@@ bling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
By not treating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not acknow@@ le@@ dging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
We are effe@@ ctively gra@@ ding someone's worth to our community .
So we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
And , most importantly , there's a partnership between those perc@@ ei@@ ved defi@@ ci@@ encies and our greatest creative ability .
So it's not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the ad@@ versity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ versity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embra@@ cing it , gra@@ pp@@ ling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
And , perhaps , if we see ad@@ versity as natural , consistent and useful , we're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
This year we celebrate the 200@@ th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illu@@ strated , I think , a truth about the human character .
To par@@ ap@@ hr@@ as@@ e: It's not the strongest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ada@@ pt@@ able to change .
Con@@ fli@@ ct is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
From Dar@@ win@@ 's work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ ou@@ rish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into trans@@ formation .
So , again , trans@@ formation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human skill .
And , perhaps , until we're tested , we don't know what we're made of .
Maybe that's what ad@@ versity gives us@@ : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give ourselves a gift .
We can re-@@ imagine ad@@ versity as something more than just tough times .
Maybe we can see it as change .
Ad@@ versity is just change that we haven't adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
I think the greatest ad@@ versity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
Now , who's normal ?
There's no normal .
There's common , there's typical . There's no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they existed ?
( Laughter ) I don't think so .
If we can change this para@@ dig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving normal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
An@@ thropolo@@ gi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contri@@ bute .
There's evidence that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 60 , 000 years ago , carried their el@@ derly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
They didn't view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
A few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in north@@ ea@@ stern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bus@@ he@@ l of tom@@ atoes .
It was su@@ mmer@@ time@@ : I had shorts on .
I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , " Well , if it isn't Ai@@ mee M@@ ull@@ ins . "
And I turn around , and it's this older man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , " I'm sorry , sir , have we met ? I don't remember meeting you . "
He said , " Well , you wouldn't remember meeting me .
I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother's wom@@ b . "
( Laughter ) Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , actually , it did click .
This man was Dr . Ke@@ an , a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
And so my mother's p@@ ren@@ at@@ al physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
And , because I was born without the fi@@ bul@@ a bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bear@@ er -- this stranger had to be the bear@@ er of bad news .
He said to me , " I had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ dependence , and you've been making liar out of me ever since . "
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade sp@@ elling bee , mar@@ ching with the Girl S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports vi@@ ctories , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching resident students , med students from Ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann Medical School and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medical School .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ actor , the potential of the human will .
No pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone's life .
And Dr . Ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , " In my experience , unless repe@@ ate@@ dly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ c@@ um of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . "
See , Dr . Ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pro@@ sthe@@ tics for fle@@ sh@@ -and-@@ bone legs , I wouldn't have hesit@@ ated for a second .
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
But if you ask me today , I'm not so sure .
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them , not in spite of the experiences I've had with them .
And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast shadows on me .
See , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you're off .
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so recep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are edu@@ cating them in the best sense .
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves .
In fact , the exact meaning of the word " edu@@ cate " comes from the root word " edu@@ ce . "
It means " to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . "
So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
There was a case study done in 196@@ 0s Britain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ mar schools to compre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
It's called the stre@@ aming trials . We call it " tracking " here in the States .
It's separ@@ ating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the " A students " get the toug@@ her cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
Well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , D-@@ level students , gave them A@@ 's , told them they were " A@@ 's , " told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were performing at A-@@ level .
And , of course , the heart@@ breaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the " A students " and told them they were " D@@ 's . "
And that's what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
Those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were dup@@ ed too .
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made .
They were simply told , " These are the '@@ A-@@ students , ' these are the '@@ D-@@ students . ' " And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them .
So , I think that the only true disa@@ bility is a crushed spirit , a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope , it doesn't see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curiosity and our in@@ na@@ te ability to imagine .
If instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
When a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century Per@@ sian poet named Ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , Jacques Dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the poem is called " The God Who Only Kno@@ ws Four Wor@@ ds " : " Every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don@@ '@@ ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , '@@ Come dance with me .
Come , dance with me . Come , dance with me . ' " Thank you .
( Applause ) I'm a writer and a journalist , and I'm also an ins@@ an@@ ely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , I've learned how to do a lot of new things .
And three years ago , one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible .
I became one of the working homeless .
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year , and decided to travel .
His death hit me pretty hard .
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that .
I've camp@@ ed my whole life . And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip .
So I packed my cat , my Ro@@ tt@@ wei@@ ler and my camping gear into a 19@@ 75 Chevy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
O@@ ne@@ : that society equ@@ ates living in a permanent structure , even a sha@@ ck , with having value as a person .
Two@@ : I failed to realize how quickly the negative per@@ cep@@ tions of other people can impact our reality , if we let it .
Thre@@ e: I failed to realize that hom@@ eless@@ ness is an attitude , not a li@@ festyle .
At first , living in the van was great .
I sho@@ wered in camp@@ grounds . I ate out regular@@ ly .
And I had time to relax and to grie@@ ve .
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in .
My fre@@ el@@ ance job ended . And I had to get a full-@@ time job to pay the bills .
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miser@@ ably hot summer .
And it became impossible to park anywhere -- ( Laughs ) -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me , and it was really hot .
The cat came and went through an open window in the van .
The do@@ ggy went into do@@ ggy day care .
And I swe@@ ated .
Whenever I could , I used employee sho@@ wers in office buildings and truck stops .
Or I washed up in public rest rooms .
Night@@ time temper@@ atures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahr@@ enheit , making it difficult or impossible to sleep .
Food ro@@ tted in the heat .
Ice in my ice chest mel@@ ted within hours , and it was pretty miserable .
I couldn't afford to find an apartment , or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Ro@@ tt@@ wei@@ ler and the cat .
And I refused to give them up , so I stayed in the van .
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public rest@@ room outside my van at night , I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet .
When winter weather set in , the temper@@ atures dropped below freezing . And they stayed there .
And I faced a whole new set of challen@@ ges .
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hass@@ led by the police .
I didn't always succeed .
But I felt out of control of my life .
And I don't know when or how it happened , but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
I hadn't changed . My I . Q . hadn't dropped .
My talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same .
But I had changed somehow .
I spir@@ aled deeper and deeper into a depression .
And eventually someone re@@ ferred me to a homeless health clinic .
And I went . I hadn't bath@@ ed in three days .
I was as sm@@ elly and as depressed as anyone in line .
I just wasn't drunk or high .
And when several of the homeless men realized that , including a former university professor , they said , " You aren't homeless . Why are you really here ? "
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless , but I did .
Then the professor listened to my story and he said , " You have a job . You have hope .
The real homeless don't have hope . "
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me su@@ icidal . And I remember thinking , " If I killed myself , no one would notice . "
A friend told me , shortly after that , that she had heard that Tim Russ@@ ert , a nation@@ ally ren@@ owned journalist , had been talking about me on national T . V .
An es@@ say I'd written about my father , the year before he died , was in Tim@@ 's new book .
And he was doing the talk show circuit . And he was talking about my writing .
And when I realized that Tim Russ@@ ert , former moder@@ ator of " Meet the Press , " was talking about my writing , while I was living in a van in a Wal@@ -@@ Mar@@ t parking lot , I started laughing .
You should too .
( Laughter ) I started laughing because it got to the point where , was I a writer , or was I a homeless woman ?
So I went in the book@@ store . And I found Tim@@ 's book .
And I stood there . And I rer@@ ead my es@@ say .
And I cried .
Because I was a writer .
I was a writer .
Sh@@ ort@@ ly after that I moved back to Tennessee .
I al@@ tern@@ ated between living in a van and couch sur@@ fing with friends .
And I started writing again .
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist .
I was winning a@@ wards . I was living in my own apartment .
I was no longer homeless .
And I was no longer invisible .
Thousands of people work full and part@@ -@@ time jobs , and live in their cars .
But society continues to st@@ ig@@ mati@@ ze and crimin@@ alize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
So the homeless , the working homeless , pri@@ mar@@ ily remain invisible .
But if you ever meet one , engage them , encourage them , and offer them hope .
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next pan@@ hand@@ ler you meet .
But I am here to tell you that , based on my experience , people are not where they live , where they sleep , or what their life situation is at any given time .
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal@@ -@@ Mar@@ t parking lot , and today I'm speaking at TED .
Hope always , always finds a way . Thank you .
( Applause ) A few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry .
In 2006 , young Q@@ at@@ ari students took me to go and see the mig@@ rant worker camps .
And since then I've followed the un@@ fol@@ ding issue of worker rights .
In the last six months , more than 300 sky@@ scra@@ pers in the U@@ A@@ E have been put on hold or canceled .
Behind the head@@ lines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the of@@ ten-@@ in@@ dent@@ ured construction worker .
1 . 1 million of them .
Main@@ ly Indian , Paki@@ stan@@ i , S@@ ri L@@ ank@@ an and Nep@@ al@@ ese , these labor@@ ers risk everything to make money for their families back home .
They pay a midd@@ le-@@ man thousands of dollars to be there .
And when they arrive , they find themselves in labor camps with no water , no air condi@@ tioning , and their pas@@ sports taken away .
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities , 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector , and so therefore we're equally , if not more , accoun@@ table .
Grou@@ ps like Buil@@ d@@ safe U@@ A@@ E have emer@@ ged , but the numbers are simply overwhel@@ ming .
In August 2008 , U@@ A@@ E public officials no@@ ted that 40 percent of the country's 1 , 0@@ 98 labor camps had viol@@ ated minimum health and fire safety regulations .
And last summer , more than 10 , 000 workers prote@@ sted for the non-@@ payment of wa@@ ges , for the poor quality of food , and in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate housing .
And then the financial collapse happened .
When the contra@@ ctors have gone bust , as they've been over@@ le@@ ver@@ aged like everyone else , the difference is everything goes missing , docum@@ entation , pas@@ sports , and tickets home for these workers .
Cur@@ rently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the bo@@ om@@ -and-@@ bust refu@@ ge@@ es .
The question is , as a building professional , as an architect , an engineer , as a develop@@ er , if you know this is going on , as we go to the s@@ ights every single week , are you compla@@ cent or compli@@ c@@ it in the human rights viol@@ ations ?
So let's forget your environmental foot@@ print .
Let's think about your eth@@ ical foot@@ print .
What good is it to build a zer@@ o-@@ carbon , energy efficient complex , when the labor produ@@ cing this archite@@ ctural gem is un@@ eth@@ ical at best ?
Now , recently I've been told I've been taking the high road .
But , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road .
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse .
And that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
Let's not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
Thank you .
( Applause ) I'd like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
Well , you probably recognize the first person .
I'm sure you're all a@@ vid " American I@@ dol " wat@@ chers .
But you might not recognize Ay@@ dah Al Ja@@ han@@ i , who is a con@@ te@@ stant , indeed a fin@@ alist , in the Po@@ et of the Milli@@ ons competition , which is broadcast out of Abu D@@ hab@@ i , and seen throughout the Arab world .
In this contest people have to write and reci@@ te original poetry , in the N@@ ab@@ ati form of poetry , which is the traditional Be@@ dou@@ in form .
And Lim@@ a Sa@@ har was a fin@@ alist in the Af@@ g@@ han Star singing competition .
Now , before I go any further , yes , I know it all began with " Brit@@ ain@@ 's Got Talent . "
But my point in discussing this is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you how these mer@@ it-@@ based competi@@ tions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner sele@@ cted via v@@ oting by SMS , are changing tri@@ bal so@@ cie@@ ties .
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the U@@ A@@ E , how they're changing tri@@ bal so@@ cie@@ ties , not by introdu@@ cing Western ideas , but by being integr@@ ated into the language in those places .
It all begins with enjo@@ y@@ ment .
Video@@ : We are late to watch " Af@@ g@@ han Star . "
We are going to watch " Af@@ g@@ han Star . " We are late .
We are running late .
We must go to watch " Af@@ g@@ han Star . "
Cynthia Schnei@@ der@@ : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .
In Afghanistan , people go to extraordinary len@@ g@@ ths to be able to watch this program .
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set .
People watch it all over the country also in public places .
But it goes beyond watching , because also , part of this is campa@@ ig@@ ning .
People become so engaged that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway , who fan out over the country@@ side , campa@@ ig@@ ning for their candidate .
Con@@ te@@ stants also put themselves forward .
Now , of course there is a certain degree of eth@@ nic alle@@ gi@@ ance , but not entirely .
Because each year the winner has come from a different tri@@ bal group .
This has opened up the door , particularly for women .
And in the last season there were two women in the fin@@ alists .
One of them , Lim@@ a Sa@@ har , is a P@@ ash@@ tun from Kan@@ da@@ har , a very con@@ serva@@ tive part of the country .
And here she rel@@ ates , in the docum@@ entary film " Af@@ g@@ han Star , " how her friends ur@@ ged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
But she also confi@@ des that she knows that members of the Tali@@ ban are actually SM@@ S-@@ ing votes in for her .
Ay@@ dah Al Ja@@ hn@@ ani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the Po@@ et of the Milli@@ ons competition .
I have to say , her husband backed her from the start .
But her tribe and family ur@@ ged her not to compete and were very much against it .
But , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
It turns out that competition and winning is a univer@@ sal human value .
And she's out there .
Her poetry is about women , and the life of women in society .
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the v@@ oting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu D@@ hab@@ i , but also people in the vie@@ wing audience .
Now you'd think that " American I@@ dol " would introduce a measure of Ameri@@ can@@ ization .
But actually , just the opposite is happening .
By using this enga@@ ging popular form@@ at for traditional , local culture , it actually , in the Gul@@ f , is pre@@ ci@@ pit@@ ating a revi@@ val of interest in N@@ ab@@ ati poetry , also in traditional dress and dance and music .
And for Afghanistan , where the Tali@@ ban bann@@ ed music for many years , it is rein@@ trodu@@ cing their traditional music .
They don't sing pop songs , they sing Af@@ g@@ han music .
And they also have learned how to lose gra@@ ce@@ fully , without a@@ ven@@ ging the winner .
( Laughter ) No small thing .
And the final , sort of , formu@@ lation of this " American I@@ dol " form@@ at , which has just appeared in Afghanistan , is a new program called " The Can@@ di@@ date . "
And in this program , people present policy plat@@ forms that are then voted on .
Many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influ@@ encing the presi@@ dential race .
So for me , the substance of things un@@ seen is how reality TV is driving reality .
Thank you .
( Applause ) I started my journey 30 years ago .
And I worked in mines . And I realized that this was a world un@@ seen .
And I wanted , through color and large form@@ at cameras and very large prints , to make a body of work that somehow became symb@@ ols of our use of the land@@ scape , how we use the land .
And to me this was a key comp@@ onent that somehow , through this medium of photogra@@ phy , which allows us to con@@ tem@@ plate these land@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , that I thought photogra@@ phy was perfectly su@@ ited to doing this type of work .
And after 17 years of photogra@@ ph@@ ing large industrial land@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , it occurred to me that oil is under@@ p@@ inn@@ ing the scale and speed .
Because that is what has changed , is the speed at which we're taking all our resources .
And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the land@@ scape of oil .
And what I want to do is to kind of map an ar@@ c that there is extra@@ ction , where we're taking it from the ground , re@@ fin@@ ement . And that's one chapter .
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities , our cars , our motor@@ cul@@ tures , where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration .
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil , this ent@@ ro@@ pi@@ c end , where all of our parts of cars , our tires , oil fil@@ ters , helic@@ op@@ ters , planes -- where are the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ es where all of that stuff ends up ?
And to me , again , photogra@@ phy was a way in which I could explore and research the world , and find those places .
And another idea that I had as well , that was brought forward by an e@@ colo@@ gist -- he basically did a calcu@@ lation where he took one lit@@ er of gas and said , well , how much carbon it would take , and how much organic material ?
It was 23 met@@ ric tons for one lit@@ er .
So whenever I fill up my gas , I think of that lit@@ er , and how much carbon .
And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phy@@ to@@ plan@@ kt@@ on , but he did the calcu@@ lations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy .
From the pho@@ to@@ syn@@ thetic growth , it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use , the 30 billion bar@@ rels we use per year .
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .
Looking at 30 billion per year , we look at our two largest supp@@ li@@ ers , Sau@@ di Arab@@ ia and now Canada , with its dirty oil .
And together they only form about 15 years of supply .
The whole world , at 1 . 2 tri@@ lli@@ on estimated re@@ serves , only gives us about 45 years .
So , it's not a question of if , but a question of when pea@@ k oil will come upon us .
So , to me , using photogra@@ phy -- and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents , our ways of thinking , to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challen@@ ging issues of our time , how to deal with our energy crisis .
And I would like to say that , on the other side of it , 30 , 40 years from now , the children that I have , I can look at them and say , " We did everything we possibly , human@@ ly could do , to begin to mi@@ ti@@ gate this , what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time . Thank you .
( Applause ) Once upon a time , at the age of 24 , I was a student at St . John's Medical College in Bang@@ al@@ ore .
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .
And that changed my min@@ d@@ set forever .
The course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the min@@ d@@ set .
It was the brutal reali@@ zation , the first morning , that the Indian students were better than me .
( Laughter ) You see , I was a study ner@@ d .
I loved stati@@ stics from a young age .
And I studied very much in Sweden .
I used to be in the upper quarter of all cour@@ ses I attended .
But in St . John's , I was in the lower quarter .
And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden .
They read the tex@@ t@@ book twice , or three times or four times .
In Sweden we read it once and then we went part@@ ying .
( Lau@@ g@@ her ) And that , to me , that personal experience was the first time in my life that the min@@ d@@ set I grew up with was changed .
And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to domin@@ ate the world forever .
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience .
It's that reali@@ zation of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world .
It's not the stati@@ stics , although I tried to make it funny .
And I will now , here , on@@ stage , try to predict when that will happen -- that Asia will re@@ gain its domin@@ ant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years .
And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India , in China , will reach that of the West .
And I don't mean the whole economy , because to grow an economy of India to the size of U . K . -- that's a piece of cake , with one billion people .
But I want to see when will the average pay , the money for each person , per month , in India and China , when will that have reached that of U . K . and the United States ?
But I will start with a historical background .
And you can see my map if I get it up here . You know ?
I will start at 18@@ 58 .
18@@ 58 was a year of great technolo@@ gical advan@@ cement in the West .
That was the year when Queen Victoria was able , for the first time , to communicate with President Buchanan , through the Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Tele@@ graphic C@@ able .
And they were the first to " Twitter " trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tically .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And I've been able , through this wonderful Google and Internet , to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria .
And it ends like this: " This tele@@ graph is a fantastic instrument to diff@@ use religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . "
Those are nice words . But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty , and liberty for whom .
And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 18@@ 58 .
Because 18@@ 58 was also water@@ shed year in the history of Asia .
18@@ 58 was the year when the coura@@ geous up@@ rising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces .
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domin@@ ation .
18@@ 58 in China was the victory in the O@@ pi@@ um War by the British forces .
And that meant that forei@@ gners , as it said in the treaty , were allowed to trade freely in China .
It meant paying with op@@ ium for Chinese goods .
And 18@@ 58 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Tre@@ at@@ y and accept trade on favor@@ able condition for the U . S .
And they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year .
But , Japan , in contra@@ st to India and China , main@@ tained its national so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty .
And let's see how much difference that can make .
And I will do that by bringing these bu@@ bbles back to a G@@ ap@@ min@@ der graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country .
The size of the bubble here is the population .
On this ax@@ is , as I used to have income per person in compar@@ able dollar .
And on that ax@@ is I have life expe@@ ct@@ ancy , the health of people .
And I also bring an inno@@ vation here .
I have trans@@ formed the laser beam into an e@@ colo@@ gical , recy@@ cl@@ able version here , in green India .
( Applause ) And we will see , you know .
Look here , 18@@ 58 , India was here , China was here , Japan was there , United States and United King@@ dom was rich@@ er over there .
And I will start the world like this .
India was not always like this level .
Actually if we go back into the historical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe .
But 18@@ 50 had already been many , many years of foreign domin@@ ation , and India had been de-@@ industri@@ alized .
And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United King@@ dom .
And they were also , by the end of the century , getting healthy , and Japan was starting to catch up .
India was trying down here .
Can you see how it starts to move there ?
But really , really natural so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty was good for Japan .
And Japan is trying to move up there .
And it's the new century now . Health is getting better , United King@@ dom , United States .
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War .
And the First World War , you know , we'll see a lot of deaths and econom@@ ical problems here .
United King@@ dom is going down .
And now comes the Spanish flu also .
And then after the First World War , they continue up .
Still under foreign domin@@ ation , and without so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , India and China are down in the corner .
Not much has happened .
They have grown their population but not much more .
In the 19@@ 30@@ 's now , you can see that Japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expe@@ ct@@ ancy .
And the Second World War was really a terrible event , also econom@@ ically for Japan .
But they did recover quite fast afterwards .
And we are moving into the new world .
In 19@@ 47 India finally gained its in@@ dependence .
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a so@@ ver@@ eign nation , but in very big difficul@@ ties down there .
( Applause ) In 19@@ 49 we saw the emer@@ gen@@ ce of the modern China in a way which surprised the world .
And what happened ?
What happens in the after in@@ dependence ?
You can see that the health started to improve .
Children started to go to school .
Health services were provided .
This is the Great Lea@@ p Forward , when China fell down .
It was central planning by Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ ung .
China recovered . Then they said , " Never@@ more , stupid central planning . "
But they went up here , and India was trying to follow .
And they were catching up indeed .
And both countries had the better health , but still a very low economy .
And we came to 197@@ 8 , and Ma@@ o T@@ se T@@ ung died , and a new guy turned up from the left .
And it was Den@@ g Xia@@ oping coming out here .
And he said , " Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black , as long as it catches mice . "
Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do .
And you can see the two cats being here , China and India , wanting to catch the mi@@ ces over there , you know .
And they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy .
And the market re@@ former was successful there .
In '9@@ 2 India follows with a market re@@ form .
And they go quite closely together , and you can see that the simil@@ ar@@ ity with India and China , in many ways , are greater than the differences with them .
And here they march on . And will they catch up ?
This is the big question today .
There they are today .
Now what does it mean that the -- ( Applause ) the a@@ ver@@ ages there -- this is the average of China .
If I would split China , look here , Shanghai has already cat@@ ched up .
Shanghai is already there .
And it's heal@@ th@@ ier than the United States .
But on the other hand , Gu@@ iz@@ h@@ ou , one of the poor@@ est in@@ land provin@@ ces of China , is there .
And if I split Gu@@ iz@@ h@@ ou into ur@@ ban and ru@@ ral , the ru@@ ral part of Gu@@ iz@@ h@@ ou goes down there .
You see this enormous ine@@ qu@@ ity in China , in the mid@@ st of fast economic growth .
And if I would also look at India , you have another type of ine@@ qu@@ ity , actually , in India .
The ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal , ma@@ cro@@ -@@ ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal difference is not so big .
U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ de@@ sh , the biggest of the states here , is poor@@ er and has a lower health than the rest of India .
Ker@@ ala is flying on top there , mat@@ ching United States in health , but not in economy .
And here , Ma@@ har@@ ash@@ tra , with Mum@@ bai , is for@@ ging forward .
Now in India , the big ine@@ qui@@ ties are within the state , rather than between the states .
And that is not a bad thing , in itself .
If you have a lot ine@@ qu@@ ity , ma@@ cro@@ -@@ ge@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal ine@@ qui@@ ties can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center rela@@ tively close to where poor people are living .
No , there is one more ine@@ qu@@ ity . Look there , United States .
( Laughter ) Oh , they broke my frame .
Washington , D . C . went out here .
My friends at G@@ ap@@ min@@ der wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system .
And I can understand him , because Washington , D . C .
is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Ker@@ ala .
It's quite interesting , isn't it ?
( Applause ) I can see a business opportunity for Ker@@ ala , helping fix the health system in the United States .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Now here we have the whole world . You have the legend down there .
And when you see the two giant cats here , pushing forward , you see that in between them and ahead of them , is the whole emer@@ ging econom@@ ies of the world , which Thomas Frie@@ dman so correctly called the " flat world . "
You can see that in health and education , a large part of the world population is putting forward , but in Africa , and other parts , as in ru@@ ral Gu@@ iz@@ h@@ ou in China , there is still people with low health and very low economy .
We have an enormous di@@ spar@@ ity in the world .
But most of the world in the middle are pushing for@@ wards very fast .
Now , back to my proje@@ ctions .
When will it catch up ? I have to go back to very conven@@ tional graph .
I will show income per person on this ax@@ is instead , poor down here , rich up there .
And then time here , from 18@@ 58 I start the world .
And we shall see what will happen with these countries .
You see , China under foreign domin@@ ation actually lo@@ wered their income and came down to the Indian level here .
Where@@ as U . K . and United States is getting rich@@ er and rich@@ er .
And after Second World War , United States is rich@@ er than U . K .
But in@@ dependence is coming here .
Gro@@ w@@ th is starting , economic re@@ form .
Gro@@ w@@ th is faster , and with proje@@ ction from IM@@ F you can see where you expect them to be in 20@@ 14 .
Now , the question is , " When will the catch up take place ? "
Look at , look at the United States .
Can you see the bubble ?
The bu@@ bbles , not my bu@@ bbles , but the financial bu@@ bbles .
That's the dot com bubble . This is the Le@@ h@@ man Brothers door@@ step there .
You see it came down there .
And it seems this is another rock coming down there , you know .
So they doesn't seem to go this way , these countries .
They seem to go in a more humble growth way , you know .
And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia .
I can compare to Japan . This is Japan coming up .
You see , Japan did it like that .
We add Japan to it .
And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place .
Can you see here what Japan did ?
Japan did it like this , until full catch up , and then they follow with the other high-@@ income econom@@ ies .
But the real proje@@ ctions for those ones , I would like to give it like this .
Can be worse , can be better .
It's always difficult to predict , especially about the future .
Now , a histor@@ ian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past .
( Laughter ) I think I'm in a difficult position here .
I@@ ne@@ qualities in China and India I consider really the big obsta@@ cle because to bring the entire population into growth and pro@@ sper@@ ity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social inst@@ ability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population .
So , social invest@@ ments in health , education and in@@ fra@@ structure , and electricity is really what is needed in India and China .
You know the climate . We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing , and actions has to be taken , otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change .
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy .
But they ain't going to pay for what others , who have more money , have lar@@ gely created , and I can agree on that .
But what I'm really worried about is war .
Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to Asia ?
And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the gover@@ nor@@ s of the world ?
So , always avoid war , because that always push@@ es human beings back@@ ward .
Now if these ine@@ qualities , climate and war can be avoi@@ ded , get ready for a world in equ@@ ity , because this is what seems to be happening .
And that vision that I got as a young student , 197@@ 2 , that Indians can be much better than Swe@@ des , is just about to happen .
And it will happen precisely the year 20@@ 48 in the later part of the summer , in July , more precisely , the 2@@ 7th of July .
( Applause ) The 2@@ 7th of July , 20@@ 48 is my 100@@ th birthday .
( Laughter ) And I expect to speak in the first session of the 3@@ 9th TED India .
Get your book@@ ings in time . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) Today , I want you to look at children who become suicide bom@@ bers through a completely different l@@ ens .
In 2009 , there were 500 bomb bla@@ sts across Pakistan .
I spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bom@@ bers and with Tali@@ ban recru@@ it@@ ers , trying to understand how the Tali@@ ban were conver@@ ting these children into live ammunition and why these children were ac@@ tively signing up to their cause .
I want you to watch a short video from my latest docum@@ entary film , " Children of the Tali@@ ban . "
( Sing@@ ing ) The Tali@@ ban now run their own schools .
They target poor families and convince the parents to send their children .
In return , they provide free food and shelter and sometimes pay the families a mon@@ thly sti@@ p@@ end .
We've ob@@ tained a pro@@ paganda video made by the Tali@@ ban .
Young boys are taught justi@@ fications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies .
I made contact with a child from Sw@@ at who studied in a ma@@ dr@@ ass@@ a like this .
Ha@@ z@@ rat Ali is from a poor far@@ ming family in Sw@@ at .
He joined the Tali@@ ban a year ago when he was 13 .
How do the Tali@@ ban in your area get people to join them ?
Ha@@ z@@ rat Ali@@ : They first call us to the mo@@ sque and p@@ reach to us .
Then they take us to a ma@@ dr@@ ass@@ a and teach us things from the Kor@@ an .
Shar@@ me@@ en O@@ ba@@ id Chin@@ o@@ y: He tells me that children are then given months of military training .
HA@@ : They teach us to use machine guns , Kal@@ ash@@ ni@@ kov , rocket laun@@ chers , gren@@ ades , bombs .
They ask us to use them only against the infi@@ d@@ els .
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
SO@@ C@@ : Would you like to carry out a suicide attack ?
HA@@ : If God gives me strength .
SO@@ C@@ : I , in my research , have seen that the Tali@@ ban have perfe@@ cted the way in which they recru@@ it and train children , and I think it's a five-@@ step process .
Step one is that the Tali@@ ban prey on families that are large , that are poor , that live in ru@@ ral areas .
They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food , clothing , shelter to these children .
Then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to hard-@@ line schools that run along the Tali@@ ban agenda .
Step two@@ : They teach the children the Kor@@ an , which is Is@@ lam@@ 's hol@@ iest book , in Arab@@ ic , a language these children do not understand and cannot speak .
They rely very heavily on teachers , who I have personally seen dist@@ ort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to .
These children are exp@@ li@@ cit@@ ly forbidden from reading newspapers , listening to radio , reading any books that the teachers do not prescri@@ be them .
If any child is found viol@@ ating these rules , he is sever@@ ely re@@ pri@@ m@@ anded .
Effe@@ ctively , the Tali@@ ban create a complete black@@ out of any other source of information for these children .
Step thre@@ e: The Tali@@ ban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in .
So they beat these children -- I have seen it ; they feed them twice a day dried bread and water ; they rarely allow them to play games ; they tell them that , for eight hours at a time , all they have to do is read the Kor@@ an .
The children are virtu@@ al prisoners ; they cannot leave , they cannot go home .
Their parents are so poor , they have no resources to get them back .
Step four@@ : The older members of the Tali@@ ban , the fighters , start talking to the younger boys about the gl@@ ories of marty@@ r@@ dom .
They talk to them about how when they die , they will be received up with la@@ kes of honey and milk , how there will be 72 vir@@ gins waiting for them in paradise , how there will be un@@ limited food , and how this glory is going to pro@@ pel them to become heroes in their neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds .
Effe@@ ctively , this is the brain@@ washing process that has begun .
Step fi@@ ve@@ : I believe the Tali@@ ban have one of the most effective means of pro@@ paganda .
Their videos that they use are inter@@ cut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Pakistan .
And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths , so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game .
That's why Paki@@ stan@@ i civilians , over 6 , 000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
Now these children are pri@@ med to become suicide bom@@ bers .
They're ready to go out and fight because they've been told that this is effe@@ ctively their only way to gl@@ ori@@ fy Islam .
I want you to watch another ex@@ cer@@ pt from the film .
This boy is called Zen@@ ola .
He blew himself up , killing six .
This boy is called Sa@@ di@@ k .
He killed 22 .
This boy is called Mess@@ oud .
He killed 28 .
The Tali@@ ban are running suicide schools , preparing a generation of boys for at@@ ro@@ cities against civilians .
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack ?
Bo@@ y: I would love to .
But only if I get permission from my dad .
When I look at suicide bom@@ bers younger than me , or my age , I get so inspired by their terrific attacks .
SO@@ C@@ : What blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack ?
Bo@@ y: On the day of judgment , God will ask me , " Why did you do that ? "
I will answer , " My Lord ! Only to make you happy !
I have laid down my life fighting the infi@@ d@@ els . "
Then God will look at my intention .
If my intention was to er@@ adi@@ cate evil for Islam , then I will be re@@ warded with paradise .
Sin@@ ger@@ : ♫ On the day of judgment ♫ ♫ My God will call me ♫ ♫ My body will be put back together ♫ ♫ And God will ask me why I did this ♫ SO@@ C@@ : I leave you all with this though@@ t: If you grew up in these circumstances , faced with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious after@@ life ?
As one Tali@@ ban recru@@ iter told me , " There will always be sacrifi@@ cial lam@@ bs in this war . "
Thank you .
( Applause ) In my industry , we believe that images can change the world .
Okay , we're naive , we're br@@ ight@@ -@@ eyed and bus@@ h@@ y-@@ ta@@ iled .
The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world , but we're also aware that , since the beginning of photogra@@ phy , images have provo@@ ked rea@@ ctions in people , and those rea@@ ctions have caused change to happen .
So let's begin with a group of images .
I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them .
They're best described as i@@ con@@ ic@@ : so i@@ con@@ ic , perhaps , they're c@@ liches .
In fact , they're so well-@@ known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form .
( Laughter ) But I think we're looking for something more .
We're looking for something more .
We're looking for images that shine an un@@ comprom@@ ising light on crucial issues , images that tran@@ sc@@ end borders , that tran@@ sc@@ end relig@@ ions , images that provo@@ ke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act .
Well , this image you've all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its sm@@ all@@ ness , its frag@@ ility .
For@@ ty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destru@@ ctive power that our species can wi@@ eld over our environment .
And at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
This destru@@ ctive power takes many different forms .
For example , these images taken by Br@@ ent Stir@@ ton in the Con@@ go .
These gor@@ ill@@ as were murdered , some would even say cruci@@ fied , and uns@@ ur@@ pri@@ sing@@ ly , they spar@@ ked international ou@@ trage .
Most recently , we've been tra@@ gi@@ cally reminded of the destru@@ ctive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Ha@@ iti .
Well , I think what is far worse is man's destru@@ ctive power over man .
Samuel Pi@@ sar , an Au@@ sch@@ witz survi@@ vor , said , and I'll quote him , " The Holo@@ cau@@ st teaches us that nature , even in its cru@@ ele@@ st moments , is ben@@ ign in compar@@ ison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . "
There's another kind of cruci@@ fix@@ ion .
The horri@@ fying images from Abu G@@ h@@ rai@@ b as well as the images from Gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo had a profound impact .
The publi@@ cation of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its poli@@ cies .
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the in@@ sur@@ gency in Iraq than vir@@ tually any other single act .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , those images forever removed the so-called moral high ground of the occup@@ ying forces .
Let's go back a little .
In the 196@@ 0s and 197@@ 0s , the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in , day out .
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war@@ : a little girl burned by na@@ palm , a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest .
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
Now , images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion , ignor@@ ance , and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image -- the issue of HIV / AIDS .
In the 198@@ 0s , the st@@ ig@@ mati@@ zation of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or ad@@ dressing it .
A simple act , in 198@@ 7 , of the most famous woman in the world , the Princess of Wales , touching an HIV / AIDS infected baby did a great deal , especially in Europe , to stop that .
She , better than most , knew the power of an image .
So when we are confron@@ ted by a powerful image , we all have a cho@@ ic@@ e: We can look away , or we can address the image .
Thank@@ fully , when these photos appeared in The Guar@@ dian in 199@@ 8 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Su@@ dan fam@@ ine relief efforts .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
Ima@@ ges often push us to question our core belie@@ fs and our responsibilities to each other .
We all saw those images after Katrina , and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact .
And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008 .
Unfortunately , some very important images are de@@ emed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .
I'll show you one photo here , and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veter@@ an from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called War Is Personal .
But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
John Moore set up this photo at Ar@@ l@@ ington C@@ emetery .
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict z@@ ones of the world , there's one photograph from a much qu@@ ie@@ ter place that ha@@ unts me still , much more than the others .
An@@ sel Adams said , and I'm going to disagree with him , " You don't take a photograph , you make it . "
In my view , it's not the photographer who makes the photo , it's you .
We bring to each image our own values , our own belief systems , and as a result of that , the image re@@ son@@ ates with us .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
I hope that the next time you see an image that spar@@ ks something in you , you'll better understand why , and I know that speaking to this audience , you'll definitely do something about it .
And thank you to all the photogra@@ pher@@ s .
( Applause )
