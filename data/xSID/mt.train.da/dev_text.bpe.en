One day , when he was in a merry mood , the demon made a look@@ ing-@@ glass which had the power of making everything good or beautiful that was refle@@ cted in it almost shrink to nothing , while everything that was worthless and bad looked increased in size and worse than ever .
This old building was beautiful .
That is strictly prohi@@ bited .

The sno@@ w-@@ flakes became larger and larger , till they appeared like great white chickens .
Do the dancing mai@@ dens sleep , or are they dead ? The scent of the flower says that they are corpses . The evening bell to@@ lls their kn@@ ell .
" Do you know where La@@ pl@@ and is ? " she asked the re@@ inde@@ er .
The woman loo@@ sen@@ ed little Ger@@ da's dress , and took off the fur boots and the mi@@ ttens , or Ger@@ da would have been unable to bear the heat ; and then she placed a piece of ice on the re@@ inde@@ er's head .
Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen , but he finds everything there so much to his taste and his liking , that he believes it is the finest place in the world ; but this is because he has a piece of broken glass in his heart , and a little piece of glass in his eye . These must be taken out , or he will never be a human being again , and the Snow Queen will re@@ tain her power over him .
It was beautiful in the country , it was sum@@ mer@@ -@@ time ; the wheat was yellow , the o@@ ats were green , the hay was sta@@ cked up in the green mea@@ dow .
In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old far@@ m-@@ house close by a deep river , and from the house down to the water side grew great bur@@ dock leaves , so high , that under the tal@@ lest of them a little child could stand up@@ right . The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood . In this snu@@ g retreat sat a duck on her nest , watching for her young bro@@ od to hatch ; she was beginning to get tired of her task , for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells , and she sel@@ dom had any visitors .
At length one shell cracked , and then another , and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried , " Pe@@ ep , pe@@ ep . "
" One egg is not ha@@ tched yet , " said the duck .
One of these eggs hasn't ha@@ tched yet .
One of these eggs hasn't ha@@ tched yet .
I am a widow .
I love God .
Oh my God !
But the poor du@@ ckling , who had cre@@ pt out of his shell last of all , and looked so ugly , was bitten and pushed and made fun of , not only by the ducks , but by all the p@@ oul@@ try .
The poor du@@ ckling did not know where to go , and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole far@@ my@@ ard .
The poor du@@ ckling was driven about by every one ; even his brothers and sisters were un@@ kind to him , and would say , " Ah , you ugly creature , I wish the cat would get you , " and his mother said she wished he had never been born .
The ducks pe@@ cked him , the chickens beat him , and the girl who fed the p@@ oul@@ try kicked him with her feet .
" They are afraid of me because I am ugly , " he said .
" What sort of a duck are you ? " they all said , coming round him . He bo@@ wed to them , and was as polite as he could be , but he did not rep@@ ly to their question . " You are exce@@ ed@@ ingly ugly , " said the wild ducks , " but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family . "
" Pop , pop , " sounded in the air , and the two wild ge@@ ese fell dead among the ru@@ shes , and the water was ting@@ ed with blood .
The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees .
" Oh , " si@@ ghed the du@@ ckling , " how thankful I am for being so ugly ; even a dog will not bite me . "
The hen had very short legs , so she was called " Chi@@ ckie short legs . " She laid good eggs , and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child .
The tom cat was the master of the house , and the hen was mistress , and they always said , " We and the world , " for they believed themselves to be half the world , and the better half too . The du@@ ckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject , but the hen would not listen to such doubts .
So the du@@ ckling left the cottage , and soon found water on which it could swim and dive , but was avoi@@ ded by all other animals , because of its ugly appearance .
Au@@ tumn came , and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold . Then , as winter approached , the wind caught them as they fell and whir@@ led them in the cold air .
All this was very sad for the poor little du@@ ckling .
One evening , just as the sun set ami@@ d radi@@ ant clouds , there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes .
The winter grew col@@ der and col@@ der ; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing , but every night the space on which he swa@@ m became smaller and smaller . At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crack@@ led as he moved , and the du@@ ckling had to pa@@ ddle with his legs as well as he could , to keep the space from closing up . He became exhausted at last , and lay still and helpless , frozen fast in the ice .
Early in the morning , a pea@@ sant , who was passing by , saw what had happened . He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe , and carried the du@@ ckling home to his wife . The warm@@ th revi@@ ved the poor little creature .
The children laughed and screa@@ med , and tum@@ bled over each other , in their efforts to catch him ; but lu@@ ckily he escaped .
It would be very sad , were I to relate all the misery and priva@@ tions which the poor little du@@ ckling end@@ ured during the hard winter .
It would be very sad , were I to relate all the misery and priva@@ tions which the poor little du@@ ckling end@@ ured during the hard winter .
He felt the warm sun shining , and heard the lar@@ k singing , and saw that all around was beautiful spring .
Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong , as he fla@@ pped them against his sides , and rose high into the air .
The app@@ le-@@ trees were in full blo@@ ssom , and the fra@@ grant el@@ ders bent their long green bran@@ ches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn .
Everything looked beautiful , in the fresh@@ ness of early spring .
From a thi@@ cket close by came three beautiful white s@@ wan@@ s , ru@@ stling their feathers , and swimming lightly over the smooth water .
But what did he see in the clear stream below ? His own image ; no longer a dark , gray bird , ugly and disagre@@ eable to look at , but a gra@@ ceful and beautiful sw@@ an .
He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble , because it en@@ ab@@ led him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him .
The great s@@ wan@@ s swa@@ m round the new@@ -@@ com@@ er , and stro@@ ked his neck with their bea@@ ks , as a welcome .
The new one is the most beautiful of all ; he is so young and pretty .
Then he felt quite ashamed , and hid his head under his wing ; for he did not know what to do .
He had been per@@ secu@@ ted and desp@@ ised for his u@@ gl@@ iness , and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds .
Then he rust@@ led his feathers , cur@@ ved his sl@@ ender neck , and cried jo@@ y@@ fully , from the dep@@ ths of his heart , " I never dreamed of such happiness as this , while I was an ugly du@@ ckling . "
They de-@@ iced the bridge with salt .

Out in the forest stood a pretty little F@@ ir Tree .
The little F@@ ir Tree wished ar@@ den@@ tly to become greater .
" Oh , if I were only as great a tree as the others ! " si@@ ghed the little F@@ ir .
When it was winter , and the snow lay all around , white and spar@@ kling , a ha@@ re would often come jumping along , and spring right over the little F@@ ir Tree . Oh ! this made him so angry .
In the au@@ tumn wood@@ cu@@ tters always came and f@@ elled a few of the largest trees ; that was done this year too , and the little F@@ ir Tree , that was now quite well grown , sh@@ ud@@ dered with fear , for the great sta@@ tely trees fell to the ground with a crash , and their bran@@ ches were cut off .
All around the walls hung pictures , and by the great stove stood large Chinese va@@ ses with lions on the covers ; there were rock@@ ing-@@ chairs , sil@@ ken so@@ fa@@ s , great tables covered with pic@@ tu@@ re-@@ books , and toys worth a hundred times a hundred dollars , at least the children said so .
Oh , how the Tree tre@@ m@@ bled !
The servants , and the young ladies also , de@@ cked out the tree . On one branch they hung little nets , cut out of colored paper ; every net was filled with swee@@ t@@ mea@@ ts ; golden apples and wal@@ nuts hung down as if they grow there , and more than a hundred little candles , red , white , and blue , were fa@@ sten@@ ed to the different bou@@ ghs .
High on the sum@@ mit of the Tree was fixed a tin@@ sel star . It was splendid , particularly splendid .
" Heaven preserve us ! " cried the young ladies ; and they ha@@ stil@@ y put the fire out .
The little ones stood quite silent , but only for a minute ; then they shou@@ ted till the room ran@@ g: they danced gle@@ e@@ fully round the Tree , and one present after another was plu@@ cked from it .
" A story ! a story ! " shou@@ ted the children .
And the servant came and chopped the Tree into little pieces .
At each explosion , which was a deep si@@ gh , the Tree thought of a summer day in the woods , or of a winter night there , when the stars bea@@ med ; he thought of Christ@@ ma@@ s-@@ eve and of Klu@@ mp@@ ey@@ -@@ Du@@ mp@@ ey , the only story he had ever heard or knew how to tell ; and then the Tree was burned .
The boys played in the garden , and the youngest had on his breast a golden star , which the Tree had worn on its happiest evening . Now that was past , and the Tree ’ s life was past , and the story is past too@@ : past ! past ! — and that's the way with all stories .

As we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth , so do they rise to unknown and glorious regi@@ ons which we shall never see .
" I know what you want , " said the sea witch . " It is very stupid of you , but you shall have your way , though it will bring you to sorrow , my pretty princess . You want to get rid of your fish@@ 's tail and to have two suppor@@ ts instead , like human beings on earth , so that the young prince may fall in love with you and so that you may have an immortal soul .
