To discover the good and bad points of a person is an easy thing , and to give an opinion concer@@ ning them is easy , too . For the most part , people think that they are being kind by saying the things that others find di@@ sta@@ st@@ eful or difficult to say . But if it is not received well , they think that there is nothing more to be done . This is completely worthless . It is the same as bringing shame to a person by sl@@ andering him .
